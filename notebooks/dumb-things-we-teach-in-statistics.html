<p>Lorem ipsum.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong>
    * In large samples, performing a normality test before using a two sample T-test for difference in population means. If we reject normality, then we use a nonparametric test for difference in centers instead. But with a large enough sample, we'll likely reject normality for even small deviations from normality. ("A goodness-of-fit test under a fixed distribution is ultimately a measure of sample size.") Yet, because of the sample size, the Central Limit Theorem has kicked in for the sample means, so the T-test will work regardless of the underlying distribution of the data (unless the data are pathological). <strong>Takeaway:</strong> with a large enough sample, a T-test will suffice for testing differences of population means.
        * See: R. Schall, "The empirical coverage of confidence intervals: Point estimates and confidence intervals for confidence levels," Biom. J., vol. 54, no. 4, pp. 537â€“551, May 2012.
        * For a contrasting opinion on using mis-specification testing before using a T-test, see <a href="https://errorstatistics.com/2018/08/13/a-spanos-egon-pearsons-neglected-contributions-to-statistics-5/">this post</a> from <a href="https://errorstatistics.com">Deborah Mayo's blog</a>.
    * Comparing baseline characteristics between two groups using significance testing when you're really interested in a difference in some <em>outcome</em>. In that case, you don't really care if the differences at baseline exist, but rather whether they're associated with the difference in the outcome.</p>
