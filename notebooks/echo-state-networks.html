Bonn, Germany: German National Research Center for Information Technology GMD Technical Report 148.34 (2001): 13. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Herbert_Jaeger3/publication/215385037_The_echo_state_approach_to_analysing_and_training_recurrent_neural_networks-with_an_erratum_note'/links/566a003508ae62b05f027be3/The-echo-state-approach-to-analysing-and-training-recurrent-neural-networks-with-an-erratum-note.pdf">link</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Gives rationale for the 'echo' in echo state network, and provides several equivalent definitions of the echo state property. Provides an illuminating example of learning a periodic-but-not-sinusoidal signal by entraining the reservoir nodes to a sinusoid, giving a diverse set of periodic-but-not-sinusoidal signals in the reservoir nodes.</li>

<ul>
<li>A more formal presentation of the echo state property in the context of non-autonomous dynamical systems. The definition of the echo state property is especially clear here. For example, the authors explicitly point out that, if a system has the echo state property, then for any given bi-infinite input sequence, there is one and only one bi-infinite state sequence that is admitted by that input sequence. This fact can be deduced from the original definition of the echo state property, but this paper makes it an explicit proposition with a proof.</li>
<li>This paper also gives the cleanest requirements on the input and state space, namely the input space should be a complete metric space, and the state space should be a compact metric space. Though, a point of confusion: under the hyperbolic tangent, \(\tanh : \mathbb{R} \to (-1, 1) \), which isn't a compact metric space...</li>
<li>Also does a good job of refuting the 'folk lore' that has sprung up around the echo state property, i.e. the claim that taking the spectral radius of the reservoir matrix less than 1 ensures the echo state property. This is a folk lore that I myself fell prey to in an <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6693319/">early paper</a>.</li>

<li>Undertakes an empirical investigation of the echo state property as a function of various common rescalings of the reservoir matrix (\mathbf{W}) and input matrix (\mathbf{W}_{\text{in}}). Finds that the appropriate rescalings are typically much larger than common practice in the literature, and thus "[suggests] that the actual domain of ESP validity is much wider than what covered by literature conditions commonly used in RC practice." The author uses one-step-ahead prediction on the Santa Fe laser time series and the sunspot time series.</li>
