<p>The incompleteness of classical graphical models (Markov Networks, Directed Acyclic Graphs, etc.) for capturing conditional independence (CI) structures.</p>

<ul>
<li>"Let me raise the question of how many probabilistic CI models can be described by graphs (cf. the question of completeness in Section 1.1, p. 3). The expressiveness of graphical methods varies. For example, for |N| = 3 there are 8 UG models and 11 DAG models (= CG models). But for |N| = 4 there are 64 UG models, 185 DAG models and 200 CG models, while for |N| = 5 there exist 1024 UG models, 8782 DAG models [6] and 11519 CG models [153]. However, this is not enough to describe CI structures induced by discrete probability measures. In the case |N| = 3 one has 22 discrete CI models but in the case |N| = 4 there are as many as 18300 CI models [136]! So, there is a tremendous gap between the number of classic graphical models and the number of discrete probabilistic CI structures in the case |N| = 4 and this gap increases with |N|. In particular, classic graphical models cannot describe all CI structures." - page 63</li>

<li>"The hope is that in the long run this approach could be utilized to make a model selection of Bayesian networks more effective. Classical model selection algorithms rely on the faithfulness assumption that data are generated from a distribution satisfying only the independencies given by some Bayesian network model. However, e.g. in the case of four variables there are only 25 different Bayesian networks while there are 18300 independence models representable by a discrete distribution (cf. [8], pp. 63). Estimating of independencies among quartets of variables instead of triplets as in PC algorithm (cf. [9], pp. 542) could better approximate the distribution by a Bayesian network."</li>
