<p>Description of the problem.</p>

<li>Big Picture<ul>
<li>Andrew Gelman, Jennifer Hill, and Masanao Yajima. "Why we (usually) don't have to worry about multiple comparisons." <em>Journal of Research on Educational Effectiveness</em> 5.2 (2012): 189-211. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/0907.2478">arXiv preprint</a><ul>
<li>A more appropriate title for this article would by "Why we (usually) don't have to worry about multiple comparisons when we perform some sort of partial pooling of estimates in a hierarchical model", though I can see why the authors decided on their pithier title. They show how to use a Bayesian hierarchical model to pool estimates in a way that (i) automatically increases the width of credible intervals by incorporating variability across groups and (ii) automatically pulls estimates of effects towards the estimate of the overall effect by pooling across group-level estimates. The authors also present their Type S and Type M error rates, which are a nice tool for thinking about hypothesis testing in situations where a point null hypothesis is obviously not true.</li>
