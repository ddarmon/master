<h3>Some Common Errors and Mis-interpretations:</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Interpretting $P_{\theta_{0}}(|T| \geq |T^{<em>}|)$ as $P(H_{0} \mid |T| = |T^{</em>}|)$, a.k.a. interpretting the $P$-value as the probability of the null hypothesis given the data<sup id="fnref:wrong1a"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:wrong1a" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inpretting $P_{\theta_{0}}(|T| \geq |T^{*}|)$ as the probability that the result occurred due to random chance. This is basically the same error as Error 1, but in even looser language.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interpretting $P_{\theta_{0}}(|T| \geq |T^{*}|)$ as the probability of making a False Positive Error, i.e. observing $p = 0.023$ does not mean you have a 2.3% chance of falsely rejecting the null. This is what the level / size / "$\alpha$" of the test controls: if you fix $\alpha$ at, say, 0.05, then under the null, you would incorrectly reject the null at most $100\alpha\%$ of the time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interpretting a small $P$-value as a strong effect. A small $P$-value indicates that (a) you have a precisely measured effect that is different from the null effect or (b) you are very unlucky.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Related to 3: interpretting statistical significance as practical significance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using $P$-values from a regression to determine which predictor / covariate / 'independent variable' is most relevant to predicting an outcome / 'dependent variable'.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>This error is often made in both directions: a large $P$-value is interpretted as indicating strong evidence for the null hypothesis, and a small $P$-value is interpretted as indicating strong <strong>direct</strong> evidence for the alternative hypothesis. Neither is true. <p> The error in the second direction requires additional clarification: a very small P-value <em>is</em> evidence against the null hypothesis. However, it is not <strong>direct</strong> evidence, in the sense of a direct interpretation of the $P$-value as $P(H_{0} \mid |T| = |T^{*}|)$. For example, the $P$-value is not generally equal to the evidence for the null hypothesis in a Bayesian framework. See: <p> J. O. Berger, T. Sellke, 1987, "Testing a Point Null Hypothesis: The Irreconcilability of P Values and Evidence," Journal of the American Statistical Association, vol. 82, no. 397, pp. 112–122, Mar. 1987.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:wrong1a" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
