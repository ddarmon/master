<p>Description of the project.</p>
<p>More text.</p>
<p>A theoretical physicist friend likes to say, only partly in jest, that there should be books titled "<strong><em>_</em>_ for Mathematicians", where </strong>___ is something generally believed to be difficult (quantum chemistry, general relativity, pricing of derivatives, formal epistemology). Those books would be short and pithy. That's because the key ideas in those hard fields boil down to a few abstract ideas that mathematicians already understand or are well equipped to understand using their toolbox of concepts. Most of the length of the normal books on those subjects comes from trying to explain those essentially mathematical ideas to people and make them comfortable with them. If you already have a strong maths background, then all you need to learn is the domain-specific stuff, which is often a surprisingly easy task.</p>
