      <description>For those who ended up here looking for information about quantum statistical mechanics or particle statistics: apologies! But sometimes I feel like physicists took all the exciting names, so I’m stealing the term quanta as it relates to an observable that can take on only discrete (not continuous values). That has interesting consequences for inferential procedures based on such discrete (“quantum”) statistics, as we will see in this post.</description>

      <description>Last time, we saw that when performing a hypothesis test with a discrete test statistic, we will typically lose size unless we happen to be very lucky and have the significance level \(\alpha\) exactly match one of our possible \(P\)-values. In this post, I will introduce a randomized hypothesis test that will regain the size we lost. Unlike a lot of randomization in statistics, the randomization here comes at the end: we randomize the \(P\)-value in order to recover the size.</description>
