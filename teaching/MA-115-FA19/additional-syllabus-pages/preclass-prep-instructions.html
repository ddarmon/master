<h1> Instructions for Downloading and Uploading Anki Decks to eCampus </h1>

<p>The following bullets lay out the submission instructions and grading procedure I will use for the Anki decks.

<p>They are a bit draconian, and the tl;dr is this:
	
<p><b>tl;dr:</b> Make sure you are regularly using Anki (at least once per day) and submit your Anki decks before each Tuesday class, and you will receive the full 5% of extra credit allotted to pre-class preparation. If you do not submit each week, or only use Anki irregularly, extra credit will be allotted accordingly.

<h2>Download and Submission Instructions</h2>
<ul>
	<li> New Anki decks will be provided on eCampus at the end of each class session.
		<ul>
			<li>You should load these into your local version of Anki by the end of that day.
		</ul>
	<li> Your Anki decks are to be uploaded to eCampus by 10:05 AM each Wednesday.
		<ul>
			<li>In Anki, use <tt>File > Export... > Export format: Anki Collection Package (*.colpkg)</tt> to export all of your Anki decks<sup><a href="#prior">[1]</a></sup>.
			<li>Upload the <tt>*.colpkg</tt> file to the appropriate <tt>Anki Deck - Due by Beginning of Lecture _</tt> assignment under <tt>Assessments > Assignments</tt>.
		</ul>
</ul>

<p id="prior"><sup>[1]</sup> If you are already using Anki, good job! Unless you want to share your personal decks with me (I wouldn't recommend it), you can create a separate profile for use with this class by selecting <tt>File > Switch Profile</tt>, and selecting <tt>Add</tt> from the dialog box.</p>
