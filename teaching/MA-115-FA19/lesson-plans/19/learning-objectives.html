<p><strong>Section 5.6: Modeling Harmonic Motion</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>State the equation for simple harmonic motion, and identify the amplitude, period, and frequency given the equation for simple harmonic motion.</li>
<li>Relate the angular frequency <span class="math">\(k\)</span> of a sine wave to its temporal frequency, which we will denote by either <span class="math">\(\nu\)</span> (the lowercase Greek letter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nu_(letter)">nu</a>) or <span class="math">\(f\)</span>. Your textbook calls temporal frequency simply &#8216;frequency&#8217;.</li>
<li>Identify the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz">unit of frequency</a> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units">International System of Units</a>.</li>
<li>State the equation for simple harmonic motion.</li>
<li>State the model for the displacement of a mass on a spring from its equilibrium position and identify the period, frequency, and amplitude of the mass&#8217;s motion.</li>
<li>Identify a model for a pure tone (sound), and identify how its parameters are related to loudness and tone.</li>
<li>Relate the frequency of a tone to the frequency of its octaves.</li>
