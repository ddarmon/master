<h1> Instructions for Submitting Post-class Reflections</h1>

<p>The following bullets lay out the submission instructions and grading procedure I will use for the post-class reflections.

If you complete a post-class reflection for each lecture, you will receive the full 5% of extra credit allotted to the post-class reflections. If you only complete the reflections sporadically, extra credit will be allotted accordingly.

<h2>Submission Instructions</h2>
<ul>
	<li> After each class, review your notes, the textbook, and any other additional resources you find useful related to material from that class.
	<li> After performing this review, write a one-page (front and back of a single notebook page) summary of the material covered in that class <strong>in your own words</strong>.
		<ul>
			<li> This should <strong>not</strong> just be a carbon copy of your class notes.
			<li> You may find the learning objectives useful as prompts for what your summary should include.
		</ul>
	<li> At the beginning of the next class, submit your one-page summary of the material covered in the previous class's lecture.
</ul>
