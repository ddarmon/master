<p><strong>Section 4.1: Exponential Functions</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Evaluate an exponential function <span class="math">\(f(x) = a^{x}\)</span> at integer and rational values of <span class="math">\(x\)</span>.</li>
<li>Specify the domain and range of an exponential function.</li>
<li>Determine whether a given function is an exponential function.</li>
<li>Sketch the graph of an exponential function <span class="math">\(f(x) = a^{x}\)</span>, including its behavior as <span class="math">\(x\)</span> approaches both positive and negative infinity.</li>
<li>Given the graph of a function <span class="math">\(f(x)\)</span>, sketch the graphs of <span class="math">\(g(x) = f(x) + c\)</span>, <span class="math">\(g(x) = f(x - c)\)</span>, <span class="math">\(g(x) = -f(x)\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(g(x) = f(-x)\)</span>.</li>
<li>Use (but do not memorize!) the formula for compound interest to find the amount of money in a savings account if the account starts with a principal <span class="math">\(P\)</span>, has yearly interest rate <span class="math">\(r\)</span>, and is compounded <span class="math">\(n\)</span> times per year for a total of <span class="math">\(t\)</span> years.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Section 4.2: The Natural Exponential Function</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Give the decimal expansion of the number <span class="math">\(e\)</span> to 3 decimal places.</li>
<li>Sketch the graph of an exponential function <span class="math">\(f(x) = e^{x}\)</span>, including its behavior as <span class="math">\(x\)</span> approaches both positive and negative infinity.</li>
