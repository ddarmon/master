<p><strong>Section 4.6: Modeling with Exponential Functions</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Given the doubling / tripling / quadrupling time <span class="math">\(a\)</span> of a population and the initial size of a population <span class="math">\(N_{0}\)</span>, develop a model for the population size as a function of time.</li>
<li>Given the relative growth rate <span class="math">\(r\)</span> of a population and the initial size of a population <span class="math">\(N_{0}\)</span>, develop a model for the population size as a function of time.</li>
<li>Given an exponential model for a population, determine the amount of time it takes for the population to reach a certain population size.</li>
<li>Given the half-life <span class="math">\(h\)</span> of a radioactive material and the amount of radioactive material present, develop a model for the amount of radioactive material as a function of time.</li>
<li>Given the proportion of radioactive material remaining in a sample relative to some starting time and the half-life <span class="math">\(h\)</span> of the radioactive material, determine the amount of time that has passed since the starting time.</li>
<li>Given the temperature of an object above a given ambient temperature and a rate constant <span class="math">\(k\)</span>, develop a model for the temperature of the warmer object as a function of time.</li>
