<p><strong>Section 12.2: Arithmetic Sequences</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Specify what makes an arithmetic sequence &#8216;arithmetic.&#8217;</li>
<li>Identify from three or more terms of a sequence, whether the sequence is arithmetic, and if the sequence is arithmetic, identify the first term <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and common difference <span class="math">\(d\)</span>.</li>
<li>Identify and use the &#8216;trick&#8217; for determining the <span class="math">\(n\)</span>-th partial sum of an arithmetic sequence by appropriately pairing up the terms in the arithmetic sequence.</li>
<li>Given a situation that can be modeled using an arithmetic sequence or the partial sum of an arithmetic sequence, identify the appropriate arithmetic sequence and / or its partial sum.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Section 12.3: Geometric Sequences</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Specify what makes a geometric sequence &#8216;geometric.&#8217;</li>
<li>Identify from three or more terms of a sequence, whether the sequence is geometric, and if the sequence is geometric, identify the first term <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and common ratio <span class="math">\(r\)</span>.</li>
<li>Identify and use the &#8216;trick&#8217; for determining the <span class="math">\(n\)</span>-th partial sum of a geometric sequence by appropriately pairing up the terms of the geometric sequence and the terms of the geometric sequence times <span class="math">\(r\)</span>.</li>
<li>Given a situation that can be modeled using a geometric sequence or the partial sum of geometric sequence, identify the appropriate geometric sequence and / or its partial sum.</li>
