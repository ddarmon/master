<h1>Study Guide for Final Exam</h1>

<p>This will be a closed-book final exam. A graphing calculator is permitted for this exam. You will be provided with <a href ="final-formula-sheet.pdf">this formula sheet</a>.</p>

<p>You will have 2 hours to complete the exam. The exam will start promptly at 8:30 AM, so please log into the Zoom session early.</p>

<p>There will be 7 problems on the exam: 3 modeled after problems from the previous exams, and 4 from the material covered since Exam 4.</p>

<p>To do well on the new material on the exam, you should be able to do the following:</p>
