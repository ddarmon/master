<p><strong>Section 12.1: Sequences and Summation Notation</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Recognize the notation <span class="math">\(a_{n} := a(n)\)</span> for a sequence as a function whose domain is the natural numbers <span class="math">\(n \in \mathbb{N}\)</span>, i.e. <span class="math">\(n\)</span> is one of the &#8216;counting numbers&#8217; <span class="math">\(1, 2, 3, \ldots\)</span>.</li>
<li>Given a closed-form expression for a sequence <span class="math">\(a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}, \ldots\)</span>, find the first <span class="math">\(N\)</span> terms of the sequence.</li>
<li>Given several terms of a sequence that can be expressed in a closed-form, determine the closed-form expression for the sequence.</li>
<li>Explain what it means for a sequence to be recursively defined.</li>
<li>Given a recursively defined sequence, determine the first <span class="math">\(N\)</span> terms of the sequence.</li>
<li>Find the <span class="math">\(n\text{th}\)</span> partial sum <span class="math">\(S_{n}\)</span> of a sequence.</li>
<li>Recognize the <span class="math">\(n\text{th}\)</span> partial sum <span class="math">\(S_{1}, S_{2},\ldots, S_{n}, \ldots\)</span> of a sequence as itself a sequence.</li>
<li>Recognize and use summation notation, aka Sigma notation, aka <span class="math">\(S_{n} = \displaystyle\sum_{k = 1}^{n} a_{k}\)</span>, for the <span class="math">\(n\text{th}\)</span> partial sum <span class="math">\(S_{n}\)</span>.</li>
<li>Use sequences and partial sums to model situations that require discrete changes to some quantity.</li>
