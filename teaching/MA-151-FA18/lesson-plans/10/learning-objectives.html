<p><strong>Section 5.4: Sampling Distributions and Estimators</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Explain why statistics computed from a simple random sample can be modeled using random variables.</li>
<li>Identify the notation <span class="math">\(\bar{X}\)</span> for the sample mean and <span class="math">\(S\)</span> for the sample standard deviation.</li>
<li>Explain the difference between the population distribution modeled by a random variable <span class="math">\(X\)</span> and the sampling distributions of statistics such as the sample mean <span class="math">\(\bar{X}\)</span> or sample standard deviation <span class="math">\(S\)</span>.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Section 5.5: The Central Limit Theorem</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Given the population mean <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span> and standard deviation <span class="math">\(\sigma\)</span> of a random variable <span class="math">\(X\)</span>, find the mean <span class="math">\(\mu_{\bar{X}}\)</span> and standard deviation <span class="math">\(\sigma_{\bar{X}}\)</span> of the sample mean <span class="math">\(\bar{X}_{n}\)</span> of a simple random sample from the population of size <span class="math">\(n\)</span>.</li>
<li>Explain, roughly, what the Central Limit Theorem says about the sample mean of a simple random sample from a population.</li>
<li>Identify the rule-of-thumb cutoff for the sample size <span class="math">\(n\)</span> when the normal approximation for a sample mean <span class="math">\(\bar{X}_{n}\)</span> applies.</li>
<li>Compute probabilities such as <span class="math">\(P(\bar{X}_{n} \leq \bar{x})\)</span>, <span class="math">\(P(\bar{X}_{n} \geq \bar{x})\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(P(a \leq \bar{X}_{n} \leq b)\)</span> given the population mean <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span>, standard deviation <span class="math">\(\sigma\)</span>, and sample size <span class="math">\(n\)</span> using the normal approximation for the sample mean.</li>
<li>Explain, roughly, why <span class="math">\(X\)</span> from a population and <span class="math">\(\bar{X}_{n}\)</span> from a simple random sample of size <span class="math">\(n\)</span> from the population have different distributions.</li>
