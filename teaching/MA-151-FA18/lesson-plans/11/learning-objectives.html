<p><strong>Section 7.1: Overview</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Answer the question: does a statistical hypothesis make a statement about a sample or a population?</li>
<li>State the &#8220;Rare Event Rule for Inferential Statistics,&#8221; as given in Triola and Triola.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Section 7.2: Basics of Hypothesis Testing</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Given a claim, identify the null hypothesis and the research / alternative hypothesis, and express both as equalities / inequalities involving the population parameter(s).</li>
<li>Given a research hypothesis, identify the corresponding null hypothesis by determining the research hypothesis&#8217;s complement, and <i>vice versa</i>.</li>
<li>Define the significance level of a hypothesis test.<br/>
<!-- 1. Given the significance level for a hypothesis test, identify the critical value(s) for a relevant test statistic. --></li>
<li>Given a test statistic, the sampling distribution of the test statistic, the significance level of the test, and the null and alternative hypotheses, identify the critical region for a hypothesis test.</li>
<li>Given a claim and sample data, calculate the value of a relevant test statistic.</li>
<li>Determine whether a one-sided or two-sided hypothesis test is appropriate for a given pair of null and research hypotheses. The textbook calls these one-tailed (left-tailed and right-tailed) and two-tailed hypothesis tests.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Section 7.4: Testing a Claim About a Mean: <span class="math">\(\sigma\)</span> Known</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Specify the requirements necessary for the <span class="math">\(Z\)</span>-based hypothesis test of a population mean to be valid.</li>
<li>Given a claim and sample data, determine whether the <span class="math">\(Z\)</span>-based hypothesis test is appropriate to test the claim.</li>
<li>Given a claim and sample data, perform a <span class="math">\(Z\)</span>-based hypothesis test for the claim about the population mean.</li>
