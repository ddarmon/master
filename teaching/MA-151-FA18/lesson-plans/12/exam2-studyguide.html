<h1>Study Guide for Exam 2</h1>

<p>This will be a closed-book exam. You will need a calculator. A calculator that performs arithmetic operations, reciprocals, square roots, powers and logarithms (base 10) is sufficient. Graphing calculators are permitted.</p>

<p>To do well on the exam, you should be able to do the following:</p>
