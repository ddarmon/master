<p><strong>Section 7.5: Testing a Claim About a Mean: <span class="math">\(\sigma\)</span> Unknown</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Compare and contrast the density histograms for the standard normal distribution and the <span class="math">\(T\)</span>-distribution with df degrees of freedom.</li>
<li>Compute a <span class="math">\(T\)</span>-statistic when given a sample mean, sample standard deviation, and sample size for a simple random sample.</li>
<li>Determine the sampling distribution of the <span class="math">\(T\)</span>-statistic when the null hypothesis about the population mean is true for a random sample of size <span class="math">\(n\)</span> from the population.</li>
<li>Determine how the sampling distribution of the <span class="math">\(T\)</span>-statistic behaves as the sample size <span class="math">\(n\)</span> increases.</li>
<li>Specify the requirements necessary for the <span class="math">\(T\)</span>-based hypothesis test of a population mean to be valid.</li>
<li>Given a claim and sample data, determine whether the <span class="math">\(T\)</span>-based hypothesis test is appropriate to test the claim.</li>
<li>Use the T-table from Appendix A&#8211;3 of Triola and Triola to determine the critical values / rejection regions for the <span class="math">\(T\)</span>-statistic when testing a null hypothesis using a rejection region of size / significance level <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span>.</li>
<li>Given a claim and summary statistics about a data set, perform a <span class="math">\(T\)</span>-based hypothesis test for the claim about the population mean.</li>
