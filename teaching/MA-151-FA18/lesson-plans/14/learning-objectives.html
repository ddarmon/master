<p><strong>Section 7.2: Basics of Hypothesis Testing</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Specify the types of decision errors that can occur when performing a hypothesis test, and give their standard names.</li>
<li>Relate the probability of a Type I error to the size of the rejection region / significance level <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> of a hypothesis test.</li>
<li>Define the power of a hypothesis test when a particular alternative hypothesis is assumed true.</li>
<li>Relate the probability of a Type II error to the power of the hypothesis test.</li>
<li>Explain the analogy between the default balance between Type I and Type II errors in hypothesis testing and the presumption of innocence in the US criminal justice system.</li>
<li>Determine which of the two error types we control in our construction of the rejection region of a hypothesis test.</li>
<li>Given a test statistic and the sampling distribution of the test statistic when the null hypothesis is true, determine the <span class="math">\(P\)</span>-value corresponding to the observed value of the test statistic.</li>
<li>Give the correct interpretation of a <span class="math">\(P\)</span>-value as the probability of observing a test statistic at least as extreme as the observed test statistic when the null hypothesis is true.</li>
<li>Explain what small and large <span class="math">\(P\)</span>-values indicate.</li>
<li>Given a <span class="math">\(P\)</span>-value for an observed test statistic and the desired size of the rejection region / significance level, determine whether the null hypothesis should be rejected.</li>
<li>State what is commonly meant by a <span class="math">\(P\)</span>-value indicating &#8216;statistical significance.&#8217;</li>
<li>State what, at the end of the day, is statistically significant.</li>
<li>Compare and contrast practical significance and statistical significance.</li>
<li>Relate the conclusion of a hypothesis test back to the original claim, and state the conclusion in plain English that a non-statistician could understand.</li>
