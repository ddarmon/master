<p><strong>Section 6.3: Estimating a Population Mean: <span class="math">\(\sigma\)</span> Known</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Explain how a point estimator is related to a population characteristic.</li>
<li>Give examples of point estimators for population parameters, like the population mean and standard deviation.</li>
<li>Compare and contrast an interval estimator and a point estimator.</li>
<li>Explain what a margin of error <span class="math">\(E\)</span> corresponds to in an interval estimator.</li>
<li>Give the <span class="math">\(100c\%\)</span> confidence interval / interval estimator for the population mean <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span> when the population standard deviation <span class="math">\(\sigma\)</span> is known.</li>
<li>State under what assumptions the confidence interval / interval estimator from the previous item is appropriate.</li>
<li>Relate the confidence level <span class="math">\(c\)</span> to the size <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> of a hypothesis test for the population mean.</li>
<li>State what quantity a confidence interval / interval estimator is <strong>for</strong>. That is, what are we confident <strong>about</strong> / what are we constructing an interval estimator <strong>for</strong>?</li>
<li>Explain what the <span class="math">\(100c\%\)</span> confidence level indicates about a confidence interval / interval estimator in a way that a layperson would understand.</li>
<li>Give the sample size <span class="math">\(n\)</span> that is necessary to achieve a margin of error <span class="math">\(E\)</span> for the population mean <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span> when the population standard deviation <span class="math">\(\sigma\)</span> is known.</li>
<li>Describe (qualitatively) the interaction between the the sample size <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, population standard deviation <span class="math">\(\sigma\)</span>, confidence level <span class="math">\(c\)</span>, and margin of error <span class="math">\(E\)</span> in the confidence interval / interval estimator for the population mean <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span>.</li>
<li>Use a <span class="math">\(100c\%\)</span> confidence interval for the population mean <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span> when the population standard deviation <span class="math">\(\sigma\)</span> is known to perform a size <span class="math">\(\alpha = 1 - c\)</span> two-tailed hypothesis test for <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span> when the population standard deviation <span class="math">\(\sigma\)</span> is known.</li>

<li>Use a <span class="math">\(100c\%\)</span> confidence interval for the population mean <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span> when the population standard deviation <span class="math">\(\sigma\)</span> is unknown to perform a size <span class="math">\(\alpha = 1 - c\)</span> two-tailed hypothesis test for <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span> when the population standard deviation <span class="math">\(\sigma\)</span> is unknown.</li>
