<p><b>Use Minitab for the following problems:
	<ol>
		<li> Enter the data (counts and expected proportions) into the cells of a Minitab Worksheet.
		<li> Use Minitab's "Stat > Tables > Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit Test (One Variable)" option to perform the \(\chi^{2}\) goodness-of-fit test.
		<li>Print the Minitab session window.
		<li>Annotate the printout by adding the null and alternative hypotheses.
		<li>Add a sketch of the density histogram for the \(\chi^{2}\) distribution when the null hypothesis is true. Use the <a href = "https://www.desmos.com/calculator/x7ihzdik2t">Desmos demo</a> we used in class to determine the shape of the density histogram with the appropriate degrees of freedom. <strong>Hint:</strong> You can change the horizontal / vertical limits of the graph by clicking on the wrench icon in the top right corner of the web page for the demo.
		<li>Indicate the observed test statistic on your sketch.
		<li>Show the rejection region defined by \(\alpha\) on your sketch, which you can find using Table A-4 in the appendix of Triola & Triola.
		<li>Add your conclusion using language from the original claim. <em>Do not just answer "Reject the null" / "Do not reject the null."</em>
