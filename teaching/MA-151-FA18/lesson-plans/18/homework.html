<p><h2>Section 8.2: </h2>
<p>For each of the following problems, use Minitab to compute the test statistic and \(P\)-value as we did in class. <em>You do not need to compute the test statistics by hand.</em> 
<p>You should:
	<ol>
		<li> Print the session window.
		<li> Annotate the printout with the null and alternative hypotheses.
		<li> Test the null hypothesis using the \(P\)-value reported by Minitab.
		<li> Test the null hypothesis using the Traditional (Rejection Region) Method using the \(z\) statistic reported by Minitab.
		<li> State your conclusion in terms of the original claim. <em>Do not just state 'reject' / 'do not reject'</em>.
	</ol>
<p>For a refresher on how to test two proportions in Minitab, see <a href="https://support.minitab.com/en-us/minitab-express/1/help-and-how-to/basic-statistics/inference/how-to/two-samples/2-proportions/before-you-start/example/">this Minitab documentation</a>.
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Be sure to use the appropriate alternative hypothesis. For example, if you are testing against the null hypothesis of <em>equality</em> of the two proportions, click on the <tt>Options...</tt> button in the <tt>Two-Sample Proportion</tt> dialog box and make sure that the <tt>Alternative hypothesis:</tt> option is set to <tt>Difference â‰  hypothesized difference</tt>.
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Since we are testing claims against a null hypothesis that includes <em>equality</em> between the two population proportions, be sure to set the <tt>Test method:</tt> option to <tt>Use the pooled estimate of the proportion</tt>.
