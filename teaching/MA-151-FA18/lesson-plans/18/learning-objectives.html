<p><strong>Section 8.2: Inferences About Two Proportions</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>State scientific or medical claims that could be tested using a hypothesis test for the difference in two population proportions.</li>
<li>Given a claim about two population proportions, determine the appropriate null and alternative hypotheses for testing that claim.</li>
<li>Distinguish between when a right-tailed, left-tailed, or two-tailed test is appropriate for testing a claim about two population proportions.</li>
<li>State when the normal approximation-based hypothesis test for the difference between two population proportions is appropriate.</li>
<li>Given a &#8216;word problem&#8217; about two population proportions and their sample estimates, identify the number of &#8216;successes&#8217; in each sample, and the number of &#8216;trials&#8217; in each sample.</li>
<li><strong>You do not need to memorize the test statistic for a hypothesis test for the difference between two population proportions.</strong></li>
<li>Use Minitab to perform a hypothesis test for the difference between two population proportions.</li>
<li>Interpret a printout from Minitab&#8217;s <tt>Two-Sample Proportion</tt> procedure, and use such a printout to test a claim about the difference between two population proportions.</li>
<li>Given a printout from Minitab&#8217;s <tt>Two-Sample Proportion</tt> procedure, determine the appropriate <span class="math">\(Z\)</span> statistic from the <span class="math">\(P\)</span>-value and vice versa.</li>
