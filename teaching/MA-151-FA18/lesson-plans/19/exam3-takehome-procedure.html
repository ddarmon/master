<h1>Procedure for the Take Home Version of Exam 3</h1>

<h3>Rescoring:</h3>

You have the opportunity to earn back half of the points you lost on the in-class version of Exam 3. This means that your maximum possible percentage, based on your Exam 3 Percentage, is
<p>\[\text{Maximum Possible Percentage} = \text{Exam 3 Percentage} + \frac{(100\% - \text{Exam 3 Percentage})}{2}\]
This is the <strong>most</strong> percentage points you can end with on Exam 3 after submitting the take home version of Exam 3.

<p>Please read the following directions <strong>carefully</strong>.

	<li> <strong>Due Date and Time:</strong> The take home version of Exam 3 is due <b>at the beginning of class</b> on Friday, November 16.

	<li> <strong>Format:</strong> The take home exam is <strong>open book and open notes</strong>. However, <strong>no collaboration</strong> is allowed, including with your classmates, other students, the Math Learning Center, a private tutor, etc.
	<li> <strong>Grading Policy:</strong> To earn points back on a problem, you must complete <strong>all</strong> parts of the problem, <strong>not just the parts you lost points on</strong>.
