<p><h2>Section 10.3: </h2>
<p>For each of the following problems, use Minitab to compute the test statistic and \(P\)-value as we did in class. <em>You do not need to compute the test statistics by hand.</em> 
<p>You should:
	<ol>
		<li> Print the session window.
		<li> Annotate the printout with the null and alternative hypotheses.
		<li> Test the null hypothesis using the \(P\)-value reported by Minitab for the Pearson \(\chi^{2}\) test.
		<li> State your conclusion in terms of the original claim. <em>Do not just state 'reject' / 'do not reject'</em>.
	</ol>
<p>For a refresher on how to test for association using a contingency table, see <a href="https://support.minitab.com/en-us/minitab/18/help-and-how-to/statistics/tables/how-to/chi-square-test-for-association/before-you-start/example/">this Minitab documentation</a>.
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The questions below state the claim in terms of (statistical) <strong>independence</strong>, which is the <em>opposite</em> of <strong>association</strong>. In statistics jargon, two random variables are <strong>associated</strong> if they are <strong>not independent</strong>. So you can test for association by testing <em>against</em> independence.
