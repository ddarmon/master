<p><strong>Section 10.3: Contingency Tables: Independence and Homogeneity</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Relate association to statistical independence.</li>
<li>State an appropriate test statistic for testing a claim of association between two categorical variables.</li>
<li>State under what conditions the <span class="math">\(\chi^{2}\)</span> test for independence is appropriate.</li>
<li>Relate the contingency tables from this section to the frequency / count tables from Chapter 3.</li>
<li>Compute estimates of probabilities from contingency tables for two categorical variables <span class="math">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math">\(Y\)</span>, including estimates of <span class="math">\(P(X = x, Y = y)\)</span>, <span class="math">\(P(X = x)\)</span>, <span class="math">\(P(Y = y)\)</span>, <span class="math">\(P(X = x \mid Y = y)\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(P(Y = y \mid X = x)\)</span>.</li>
<li>Explain how to compute the expected frequencies (counts) under the null model of independence using the multiplication rule for independent events.</li>
<li>Distinguish between statistical association and causation.</li>
