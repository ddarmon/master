<p><h2>Section 8.3: </h2>
<p>For each of the following problems, use Minitab to compute the test statistic and \(P\)-value as we did in class. <em>You do not need to compute the test statistics by hand.</em> 
<p>You should:
	<ol>
		<li> Print the session window.
		<li> Annotate the printout with the null and alternative hypotheses.
		<li> Test the null hypothesis using the \(P\)-value reported by Minitab for the 2-sample \(T\)-test.
		<li> State your conclusion in terms of the original claim. <em>Do not just state 'reject' / 'do not reject'</em>. 
		<ul><li>For example, for Problem 8.3.5, your conclusion should be in terms of the claim that the population of heavy users of marijuana has a lower mean score of memory recall than the light users of marijuana.</ul>
	</ol>
<p>For a refresher on how to perform a \(T\)-test with two independent samples using Minitab, see <a href="https://support.minitab.com/en-us/minitab/18/help-and-how-to/statistics/basic-statistics/how-to/2-sample-t/perform-the-analysis/enter-your-data/">this Minitab documentation</a>. <strong>Hint:</strong> For these problems, you want to enter the <em>summarized data</em>.

<p><strong>Important:</strong> Be sure you choose the correct alternative hypothesis to test the claim in the <tt>Options...</tt> dialog box.

<p><h2>Additional Problem on Assessing Normality: </h2>

Use <a href="MA-151-FA18/lesson-plans/21/HEALTH.MPJ">this Minitab data set</a> from Triola & Triola to answer the following questions. This is Data Set 1 from Appendix B of Triola & Triola, which consists the health exam results for 40 men and 40 women from the <a href = "https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/nhanes_products.htm">National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey</a>. The worksheet with male data is called MHEALTH and the worksheet with female data is called FHEALTH.

Use this data set to perform the following steps:
<ol>
	<li> Determine if the cholesterol levels in the male subjects are approximately normal.
		<ul>
			<li> Plot a frequency histogram of the cholesterol levels with a normal density histogram overlayed.
			<li> Plot a probability plot comparing the observed cholesterol levels to the expected cholesterol levels under the normal density histogram.
			<li> Test for normality using one of the Anderson-Darling or Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests.
			<li> Based on these three results, state your conclusion about whether the cholesterol levels are normally distributed.
		</ul>
	<li> Repeat the above steps to determine whether cholesterol levels in the female subjects are approximately normal.
	<li> For the above steps, print out the plots. <strong>You do not need to print out the session window or the worksheets for the above steps.</strong>
	<li> Regardless of your conclusion about the normality for the cholesterol levels in men and women (since \(n > 30\) for both samples), test the claim that the average cholesterol levels between men and women differ at the \(\alpha = 0.01\) significance level.
		
		<p> <strong>Hint:</strong> Remember that you can get the necessary summary statistics from each of the two samples using <tt>Stat > Basic Statistics > Display Descriptive Statistics...</tt>.
		<ul>
			<li> Print out the session window.
			<li> Annotate the printout with the null and alternative hypotheses.
			<li> Test the null hypothesis using the P-value reported by Minitab
			<li> State your conclusion as it relates to the original claim, <em>not just as</em> 'reject the null' / 'do not reject the null'.
		</ul>
