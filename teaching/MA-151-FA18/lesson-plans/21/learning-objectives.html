<p><strong>Section 5.7: Assessing Normality</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Explain why we should investigate whether the values in a sample are approximately normally distributed when the sample size is less than 30 before using any of the inferential procedures we developed for population means.</li>
<li>Follow the three step procedure for normality testing:

<ul>
<li>Plot a frequency histogram of the data.</li>
<li>Plot a probability plot of the data.</li>
<li>Perform a formal hypothesis test for normality of the population.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Explain what a normal probability plot should look like when the population is: (a) normally distributed and (b) not normally distributed.</li>
<li>State the names of at least two test statistics for testing the normality of the density histogram of a population.</li>
<li>State the null and alternative hypotheses for a normality test.</li>
<li>Interpret a <span class="math">\(P\)</span>-value from a normality test in terms of a claim about whether the population is normally distributed.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Section 8.3: Inferences About Two Means: Independent Samples</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Give example claims in science, medicine, and nutrition involving two population means.</li>
<li>State a claim about two population means using an equality / inequality. For example, <span class="math">\(\mu_{1} > \mu_{2}\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\mu_{1} \neq \mu_{2}\)</span>, etc.</li>
<li>State the null and alternative hypotheses resulting from a claim about two population means both in terms of <span class="math">\(\mu_{1}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\mu_{2}\)</span>, and in terms of the difference parameter <span class="math">\(\delta = \mu_{1} - \mu_{2}\)</span>.</li>
<li>State the conditions when the two sample <span class="math">\(T\)</span>-test with independent samples is appropriate for testing a claim about two population means from two samples from those populations.</li>
<li>State the test statistic for the two sample <span class="math">\(T\)</span>-test with independent samples.</li>
<li>Use Minitab to perform a two sample <span class="math">\(T\)</span>-test with independent samples.</li>
<li>Interpret the output of Minitab&#8217;s two sample <span class="math">\(T\)</span>-test with independent samples as they relate to a claim about two population means.</li>
