<p><h2>Section 8.4: </h2>

<p>For each of the following problems, use Minitab to compute the test statistic and \(P\)-value as we did in class. <em>You do not need to compute the test statistics by hand.</em> 
<p>You should:
	<ol>
		<li> Print the session window.
		<li> Annotate the printout with the null and alternative hypotheses.
		<li> Test the null hypothesis using the \(P\)-value reported by Minitab for the paired \(T\)-test.
		<li> Test the null hypothesis using the observed \(T\)-value and degrees of freedom reported by Minitab via the critical / rejection region method, i.e. the "Traditional Method". Use the T-table in the appendix of Triola & Triola or <a href = "../13/T-table.pdf">this</a> T-table to determine the critical values.
		<li> State your conclusion in terms of the original claim. <em>Do not just state 'reject' / 'do not reject'</em>. 
		<ul><li>For example, for Problem 8.4.8b, your conclusion should be in terms of the claim that captopril is effective in lowering systolic blood pressure.</ul>
	</ol>
<p>For a refresher on how to perform a paired \(T\)-test using Minitab, see <a href="https://support.minitab.com/en-us/minitab/18/help-and-how-to/statistics/basic-statistics/how-to/paired-t/before-you-start/example/">this Minitab documentation</a>.

<p><strong>Important:</strong> Be sure you choose the correct alternative hypothesis to test the claim in the <tt>Options...</tt> dialog box.
