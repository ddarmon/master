<p><strong>Section 8.4: Inferences from Matched Pairs</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Explain what it means to have &#8216;matched pairs&#8217; in a study with two samples.</li>
<li>Explain why matched pairs violates one of the assumptions of the 2-sample <span class="math">\(T\)</span>-test with independent samples.</li>
<li>State claims about population means for matched pairs in terms of the individual means and the difference in the means.</li>
<li>Give examples of studies in nutrition, exercise, and medicine that might use a matched pair design.</li>
<li>State the test statistic for a paired <span class="math">\(T\)</span>-test, and give its sampling distribution under the null hypothesis.</li>
<li>Explain, roughly, why the 2-sample <span class="math">\(T\)</span>-test with independent samples and the paired <span class="math">\(T\)</span>-test might result in different conclusions using the same data.</li>
<li>Determine, based on the design of a study, whether a 2-sample <span class="math">\(T\)</span>-test with independent samples or a paired <span class="math">\(T\)</span>-test would most appropriate for testing a claim about the population means.</li>
<li>Interpret Minitab&#8217;s output from its paired <span class="math">\(T\)</span>-test routine.</li>
<li>Given summary statistics about the mean and standard deviation of difference scores from matched samples, use the appropriate <span class="math">\(T\)</span>-statistic to test a claim about the population means.</li>
