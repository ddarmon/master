<p><h2>Section 9.2: </h2>
<p> For each of the following problems:
<ol>
	<li>Use Minitab to make a scatter plot of the two variables. Print the scatter plot.
	<li>On the printout, describe the trend between the two variables and state its strength.
	<li>Use Minitab to estimate the linear (Pearson) correlation \(r\) between the two variables.
	<li>Use Minitab to perform a hypothesis test for the population linear correlation \(\rho\).
	<li>Use <a href="http://vassarstats.net/rho.html">this web applet</a> to compute a 95% confidence interval for the population linear correlation \(\rho\).
	<li> Print the session window.
	<li> Annotate the printout with the estimate of the linear correlation from Part 3.
	<li> Annotate the printout with the null and alternative hypotheses for the hypothesis test from Part 4.
	<li> Annotate the printout with the confidence interval from Part 5.
	<li> State your conclusion based on the \(P\)-value from Part 4, and relate your conclusion back to the original question from the problem.
