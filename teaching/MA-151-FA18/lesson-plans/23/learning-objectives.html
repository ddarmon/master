<p><strong>Section 9.2: Correlation</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>State what it means, loosely, for two quantitative variables to be associated.</li>
<li>Interpret a scatter plot of two quantitative variables.</li>
<li>State the trend of two quantitative variables given a scatter plot.</li>
<li>State the strength of the trend of two quantitative variables given a scatter plot.</li>
<li>Recognize the names linear correlation coefficient, Pearson correlation coefficient, and &#8216;the&#8217; correlation coefficient as synonyms.</li>
<li>Identify the notation used for the sample correlation <span class="math">\(r\)</span> and the population correlation <span class="math">\(\rho\)</span> (the lowercase Greek letter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rho">rho</a>).</li>
<li>State the range of values that the sample correlation <span class="math">\(r\)</span> and the population correlation <span class="math">\(\rho\)</span> can take, and what those values correspond to in terms of the presence / absence of a linear trend in the sample data.</li>
<li>State when the sampling distribution used for hypothesis testing and confidence intervals is appropriate for a given data set.</li>
<li>State the null and alternative hypotheses for a claim about the correlation between two outcomes in a population.</li>
<li>Use the <span class="math">\(P\)</span>-value provided by Minitab to test a claim about the correlation between two outcomes in a population.</li>
<li>Perform the hypothesis testing routine in the right column of page 334 of Triola &amp; Triola for a claim about a population correlation.</li>
<li>Interpret a confidence interval, like the one provided by <a href="http://vassarstats.net/rho.html">this web applet</a>, in terms of the correlation between two outcomes in a population.</li>
<li>Distinguish between correlative and causative statements about two outcomes, and give examples of correlative statements that do not imply causative statements.</li>
