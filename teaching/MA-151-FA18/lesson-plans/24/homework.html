<p><h2>Section 9.3: </h2>
<p> For each of the following problems:
<ol>
	<li> Use Minitab to generate a scatter plot with a line of best fit:
		<ul>
			<li> From the top menu bar, select <tt>Stat > Regression > Fitted Line Plot...</tt>.
			<li> Select the appropriate response and predictor.
			<li> Select <tt>Linear</tt> for the <tt>Type of Regression Model</tt>.
		</ul>
	<li> Print out the scatter plot.
	<li> Annotate the print out with a description of the trend and its strength.
	<li> Use Minitab to estimate the linear regression model using <tt>Stat > Regression > Fit Regression Model...</tt>.
	<li> Print the session window.
	<li> Annotate the printout with the estimate of the linear regression model.
	<li> Annotate the printout with your interpretation of the slope and intercept of the linear regression model.
	<li> Annotate the printout with your interpretation of the Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) / Standard Error of Prediction. Minitab calls this <tt>S</tt>.
	<li> Annotate the printout with the best prediction for the response variable at the specified value of the predictor variable.
</ol>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> For problems 9.3.16 and 9.3.17, switch the direction of prediction: predict the cholesterol level (CHOL) of a woman using either Body Mass Index (BMI) or weight (WT). So the <em>response</em> is the cholesterol level, and the <em>continuous predictor</em> is either the BMI or the weight.
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> You can either enter the data into Minitab manually, or use the Minitab files provided through the links below.
