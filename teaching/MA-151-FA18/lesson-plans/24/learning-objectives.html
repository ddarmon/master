<p><strong>Section 9.3: Regression</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Define the terms &#8220;response&#8221; and &#8220;predictor&#8221; in the context of predicting one outcome from another, and identify what outcome is the response and what outcome is the predictor when give a prediction problem.</li>
<li>Specify how a regression function is related to the task of predicting one outcome from another.</li>
<li>Specify the form of a simple linear regression of a response <span class="math">\(y\)</span> on a predictor <span class="math">\(x\)</span>. Equivalently, identify the form of a simple linear regression model for predicting a response <span class="math">\(y\)</span> using a predictor <span class="math">\(x\)</span>.</li>
<li>Perform a simple linear regression using Minitab.</li>
<li>Recall, from either high school or college algebra / precalculus, the equation for a line and the interpretation of the slope and intercept of the line.</li>
<li>Identify the slope and intercept from a simple linear regression model, and interpret the slope and intercept in the context of the prediction problem.</li>
<li>Explain, with an example, why the <em>causal</em> interpretation of the slope of a simple linear regression model as &#8216;the amount that the response increases as the predictor increases by 1 unit&#8217; is generally not correct.</li>
<li>Use a simple linear regression model to identify the best prediction of the response at a given value of the predictor.</li>
<li>Explain, qualitatively, in what sense the line determined by simple linear regression is the &#8216;line of best fit.&#8217; That is, what do we mean by &#8216;fit&#8217; and what do we mean by &#8216;best&#8217;?</li>
<li>Determine the error of a prediction given a simple linear regression model, a value for the predictor, and a response at that value of the predictor.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Section 9.4: Variation and Prediction Intervals</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Explain why the variation of the frequency histogram for the prediction errors of a simple linear regression gives one indication of how good the model is at prediction.</li>
<li>Define the root-mean-square error (RMSE), <em>aka</em> standard error of prediction (<span class="math">\(S\)</span>), in terms of the distribution of the prediction errors.</li>
<li>Interpret the RMSE / <span class="math">\(S\)</span> in terms of the proportion of errors that fall within <span class="math">\(\pm k \cdot S\)</span> for <span class="math">\(k = 1, 2, 3\)</span>.</li>
<li>Give two equivalent definitions of the coefficient of determination, <em>aka</em> <span class="math">\(R^{2}\)</span>, <em>aka</em> <tt>R-sq</tt>.</li>
<li>State the common (<a href="http://bactra.org/weblog/874.html">though erroneous</a>) way to use <span class="math">\(R^{2}\)</span> as a way to evaluate a simple linear regression model.</li>
