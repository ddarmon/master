<p><h2>Multiple Linear Regression and Model Selection: </h2>
<p> <strong>Important:</strong> You will need to use Minitab on a PC, <strong>not</strong> Minitab Express on a Mac, to complete this assignment. Minitab Express, as the name suggests, does not have all the functionality that of Minitab.
<p> Download <a href="BODYFAT-PREDICTION.MPJ">this Minitab project</a> containing the data we used for body fat prediction in the previous three class sessions. 
<p> The goal of this assignment is to determine the best model for predicting body fat percentage from various other biometrics using a multiple linear regression. The response is body fat percentage, and we will consider the following predictors:
	<ul>
		<li>age
		<li>weight
		<li>height
		<li>BMI
		<li>neck
		<li>chest
		<li>abdomen
		<li>hip
		<li>thigh
		<li>knee
		<li>bicep
		<li>ankle
		<li>forearm
		<li>wrist
	</ul>
<p> Assume that all measurements after BMI are circumferences of the body part in question.
<ol>
	<li><strong>Generate a Matrix Plot:</strong>
	<ol>
	<li> Use Minitab to to generate matrix plot showing each of the predictors plotted against themselves and against the response.
		<ul>
			<li> From the top menu bar, select <tt>Stat > Matrix Plot...</tt>.
			<li> Select the <tt>Simple</tt> option from the second row.
			<li> In the <tt>Y variables:</tt> text box, include the response.
			<li> In the <tt>X variables:</tt> text box,  enter the predictors listed above
		</ul>
	<li> Print out the matrix plot.</ol>
	<li><strong>Fit a Multiple Linear Regression with All of the Predictors:</strong>
	<ol>
	<li> Use Minitab to estimate the multiple linear regression model that includes all of the candidate predictors at once, using <tt>Stat > Regression > Regression > Fit Regression Model...</tt>.
		<ul>
			<li> <strong>Important:</strong> Be sure to also generate the diagnostic plots by clicking the <tt>Graphs...</tt> button in the dialog box, and selecting the <tt>Four in one</tt> radio button from the resulting window.
		</ul>
	<li> Print the session window and the diagnostic plots.
	<li> Annotate the printout with the estimate of the linear regression model.
	<li> Annotate the printout with your interpretation of the coefficients and intercept of the linear regression model.
	<li> Give your interpretation of the diagnostic plots. Does it appear that the assumptions about how the residuals should behave to make inferences hold for this data? If not, how do the diagnostic plots show deviation from the violated assumption(s)?
	</ol>
	<li><strong>Select a Model Using Mallow's \(C_{p}\) and Best Subset Selection:</strong>
	<ol>
		<li> Use Minitab to fit multiple linear regressions using all of the possible subsets of the predictors.
			<ul>
				<li> Select <tt>Stat > Regression > Regression > Best Subsets...</tt> in the menu bar.
				<li> Select body.fat as the response.
				<li> Select the predictors listed above as the free predictors.
				<li> Select <tt>Options...</tt> and enter 1 in the <tt>Models of each size to print:</tt> text box.
			</ul>
		<li> Select the model for which <tt>Mallows Cp</tt> is first smaller than the number of variables in the model plus 1, i.e. the <tt>Vars</tt> column plus 1. (We need to add 1, since 'p' here stands for the number of coefficients, and we are also fitting a coefficient for the intercept.)
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Hint:</strong> This value should occur in the 5 to 10 range.
				<li><strong>Hint:</strong> This value may be easier to find if you plot the <tt>Mallows Cp</tt> column against the <tt>Vars</tt> column + 1. You can copy and paste these columns into a worksheet by right-clicking on the column and selecting the <tt>Copy</tt> option from the context menu.
			</ul>
	</ol>
	<li><strong>Interpret the Selected Model:</strong>
	<ol>
		<li> What predictors are included in the model you selected?
		<li> Does this list of predictors make sense, given what you know about how subcutaneous and visceral fat are distributed on the human body? You may find the <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adipose_tissue">Wikipedia article on adipose fat</a> useful for answering this question.
