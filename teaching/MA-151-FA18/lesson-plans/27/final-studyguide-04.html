<h1>Study Guide for Final Exam</h1>

<p>This will be a closed-book final exam.</p>
	
<p>You are permitted one 8.5 inch by 11 inch sheet of <strong>handwritten</strong> notes (both sides) for the final exam.</p>

<p>You will need a calculator. A calculator that performs arithmetic operations, reciprocals, square roots, powers and logarithms (base 10) is sufficient. Graphing calculators are permitted.</p>

<p>You will have 2 hours to complete the exam. The exam will start promptly at 8:30 AM, so please arrive on time.</p>

<p>There will be 7 questions on the exam: 4 modeled after problems from the previous exams, and 3 from the material covered since Exam 3.</p>

<p>To do well on the new material on the exam, you should be able to do the following:</p>
