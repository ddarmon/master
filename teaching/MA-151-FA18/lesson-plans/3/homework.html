<p><h2>Data Set Problem:</h2>
Using the <a href="MA-151-FA18/lesson-plans/2/DIET-STUDY-DATA.MPJ">weight loss data set</a> from Lecture 2, determine the proportion (percentage) of individuals in the  <b>low fat</b> group who had a weight loss:
<dl>
<dd> ■ within one standard deviation of the average weight loss.
<dd> ■ within two standard deviations of the average weight loss.
<dd> ■ within three standard deviations of the average weight loss.
</dl>
Do these proportions match the standard deviation rule-of-thumb for bell-shaped distributions? See the green box on page 61 of the textbook for a reminder of the standard deviation rule-of-thumb.
<p> <b>Hint:</b> It will be useful to <i>sort</i> the data first first. Then take advantage of the row labels and your knowledge of the number of individuals in the low fat group to find the proportions.
