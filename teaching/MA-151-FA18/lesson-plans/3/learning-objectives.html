<p><strong>Section 2.5: Measures of Variation</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Explain, in plain English, what variation means in the context of a data set.</li>
<li>Define the range of a data set.</li>
<li>Explain why the average of the deviations of data points from their average does not give a satisfactory measure of variation.</li>
<li>Explain, in words, how to compute the standard deviation from a data set.</li>
<li>Specify the units of standard deviation, given the units of a data set.</li>
<li>Use the range rule of thumb to make approximate conversions from ranges to standard deviations and <i>vice versa</i>.</li>
<li>Use the standard deviation rule of thumb to determine whether a sample value is unusual given a data set&#8217;s mean and standard deviation.</li>
<li>Given the mean and standard deviation from a data set with a bell-shaped distribution, estimate the proportion of sample values that fall within 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations from the mean.</li>
<li>Compute the standard deviation of a data set using Minitab.</li>
