<p><strong>Section 3.2: Fundamentals (of Probability)</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Define event, simple event, and sample space.</li>
<li>Explain the relative frequency definition of probability.</li>
<li>Estimate probabilities as relative frequencies given frequency data.</li>
<li>Determine the events from a word problem (like the examples on page 95 - 97 and the homework) and compute the probability of an event using the classical approach to probability.</li>
<li>Specify the allowed range for a probability, and identify probabilities associated with certain, likely, unlikely, and impossible events.</li>
<li>Convert from probabilities given as proportions to probabilities given as percentages and <i>vice versa</i>.</li>
<li>Relate the probability that an event does not occur to the probability that the event does occur.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Section 3.3: Addition Rule (of Probability)</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Define a compound event.</li>
<li>Explain the meaning of &#8216;or&#8217; in the statement &#8220;<span class="math">\(A\)</span> or <span class="math">\(B\)</span>&#8221; occurs, where <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> are events. <b>Important:</b> It is <i>not</i> the common English meaning of &#8216;or&#8217;.</li>
<li>State the addition rule for probabilities.</li>
<li>Use Venn diagrams to reason about the probability of compound events.</li>
<li>Compute the probability of compound events, given the appropriate frequencies.</li>
<li>Define complementary events, and relate the probability of an event to the probability of its complement.</li>
