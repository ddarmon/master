<p><strong>Section 3.4: Multiplication Rule (of Probability): Basics</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Explain the difference between sampling with replacement and sampling without replacement.</li>
<li>Explain the interpretation of a conditional probability <span class="math">\(P(A \mid B)\)</span> in terms of the number of times that <span class="math">\(B\)</span> occurred and the number of times <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> occurred.</li>
<li>Explain the interpretation of a conditional probability <span class="math">\(P(A \mid B)\)</span> as the probability of <span class="math">\(A\)</span> given knowledge of <span class="math">\(B\)</span>.</li>
<li>Give the definition of the conditional probability <span class="math">\(P(A \mid B)\)</span> in terms of <span class="math">\(P(A \text{ and } B)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(P(B)\)</span>.</li>
<li>Explain how to &#8216;factor&#8217; <span class="math">\(P(A \text{ and } B)\)</span> in terms of marginal and conditional probabilities, aka the Multiplication Rule.</li>
<li>Define the independence of two events <span class="math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math">\(B\)</span> in terms of factoring the probability <span class="math">\(P(A \text{ and } B)\)</span> and in terms of the conditional probabilities <span class="math">\(P(A \mid B)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(P(B \mid A)\)</span>.</li>

<p><strong>Section 3.5: Multiplication Rule (of Probability): Beyond the Basics</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Define the complement of an event, and identify the complement of an event on a Venn Diagram.</li>
<li>Compute the probability that at least one event occurs using the probability the probability that no events occur.</li>
<li>Compute conditional probabilities from contingency tables.</li>
<li>Compute conditional probabilities given base rates and conditional probabilities using a diagram of natural frequencies.</li>
