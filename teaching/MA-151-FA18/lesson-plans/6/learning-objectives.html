<p><strong>Section 4.2: Random Variables</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Denote a random variable by a capital letter and a particular value the random variable can take by a lowercase letter. For example, we might denote the number appearing after the roll of a six-sided die by <span class="math">\(X\)</span> and one of the particular numbers by <span class="math">\(x\)</span>.</li>
<li>Explain in what sense a random variable is a number that could have been otherwise.</li>
<li>Explain what a probability distribution tells us about a random variable.</li>
<li>Denote the probability distribution of a random variable <span class="math">\(X\)</span> by <span class="math">\(P(X = x)\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(x\)</span> is a particular value the random variable can take.</li>
<li>Define what it means for a random variable to be discrete or continuous, and distinguish between discrete and continuous random variables when given their description.</li>
<li>Construct a probability histogram for a discrete random variable given its probability distribution.</li>
<li>Specify the properties that a probability distribution must satisfy, and check if a given probability distribution satisfies those properties.</li>
<li>Explain what the expectation of a random variable means under a frequency-based model of probability.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Section 4.3: Binomial Probability Distributions</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Specify the properties that must be true of a procedure for its outcome to be well-modeled by a binomial random variable.</li>
<li>Identify the roles played by <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, <span class="math">\(p\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(x\)</span> in the probability distribution of a binomial random variable.</li>
<li>Extract <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, <span class="math">\(p\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(x\)</span> from the description of a procedure whose outcome is well-modeled by a binomial random variable.</li>
<li>Interpret and use a table like Table A&#8211;1 from Appendix A of Triola and Triola to find <span class="math">\(P(X = x; n, p)\)</span>.</li>
<li>Use (but do not memorize) the formula <span class="math">\(P(X = x; n, p) = \dfrac{n!}{(n-x)!x!} p^{x} (1 - p)^{n - x}\)</span> to find the probability of <span class="math">\(x\)</span> successes in <span class="math">\(n\)</span> trials.</li>
<li>Convert events such as &#8220;at least 1,&#8221; &#8220;at most 2,&#8221; &#8220;fewer than 3,&#8221; and &#8220;more than 10&#8221; to the appropriate values of a binomial random variable with <span class="math">\(n\)</span> trials.</li>
<li>Compute the probability of events like those in the previous learning objective using the probability distribution of a binomial random variable.</li>
