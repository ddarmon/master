<h1>Study Guide for Exam 1</h1>

<p>This will be a closed-book exam. You will need a calculator. A calculator that performs arithmetic operations, reciprocals, square roots, powers and logarithms (base 10) is sufficient. Graphing calculators are permitted.</p>

<p>To do well on the exam, you should be able to do the following:</p>
<h3>Chapter 1</h3>

</ol>

<li>Given a frequency histogram for a data set, eyeball the median.</li>
<li>Compute the median of a (small) data set.</li>
<li>Explain why the median is less sensitive to outliers in a data set than the mean.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>Explain, in plain English, what variation means in the context of a data set.</li>
<li>Define the range of a data set.</li>

<li>Specify the units of standard deviation, given the units of a data set.</li>
<li>Use the range rule of thumb to make approximate conversions from ranges to standard deviations and <i>vice versa</i>.</li>
<li>Use the standard deviation rule of thumb to determine whether a sample value is unusual given a data set&#8217;s mean and standard deviation.</li>
<li>Given the mean and standard deviation from a data set with a bell-shaped distribution, estimate the proportion of sample values that fall within 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations from the mean.</li>
