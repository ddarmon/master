<h2>Homework 12: Additional Problems</h2>

<p>Assume that each of the samples below are a random sample from a population that is approximately normally distributed.

<p>For each of the following problems:

<ol>
  <li>State the claim in terms of an equality/inequality involving the population mean.</li>
  <li>Determine whether the claim corresponds to a null or alternative hypothesis.</li>
  <li>Determine the complementary hypothesis to the claim.</li>
  <li>State the null and alternative hypotheses.</li>
  <li>Determine the type of evidence, involving the sample mean, which would be evidence <em>against</em> the null hypothesis.</li>
  <li>Draw the density curve for \(T\) under the null hypothesis.</li>
  <li>Determine the observed value of the \(T\)-statistic \(t_{\text{obs}}\) from the sample properties, and indicate where this value falls under the density curve.</li>
  <li>Determine whether the observed \(T\)-statistic gives evidence against the null.</li>
</ol>
