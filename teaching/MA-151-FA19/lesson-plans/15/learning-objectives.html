<h4 id="p-valueandstatisticalsignificance"><span class="math">\(P\)</span>-value and statistical significance</h4>

<ol>
<li>State how a <span class="math">\(P\)</span>-value is defined for an observed test statistic and a given null hypothesis.</li>
<li>State the rejection rule for using the <span class="math">\(P\)</span>-value of an observed test statistic to reject (or not) the null hypothesis at a given significance level <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span>.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="chapter15">Chapter 15</h3>

<h4 id="howhypothesistestsbehave">How hypothesis tests behave</h4>

<ol>
<li>Define the two types of errors one can make in a hypothesis test, and state their names.</li>
<li>Relate the two types of errors that one can make in a hypothesis test to decisions in legal trials and during warfare.</li>
<li>Define the two error rates of a hypothesis test.</li>
<li>Recognize <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> as indicating the Type I Error Rate of a hypothesis test.</li>
<li>Recognize the synonym of &#8220;significance level&#8221; for the Type I Error Rate <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span>.</li>
<li>State which of the two error rates are explicitly controlled for in constructing a hypothesis test.</li>
<li>Define test statistic, and explain the distinction between a test statistic and an observed test statistic.</li>
<li>Define the rejection region of a hypothesis test, and state how the rejection region is used to make a conclusion about a null hypothesis.</li>
<li>State the 7 step procedure for testing a claim about a population using a hypothesis test that controls the Type I Error Rate.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="theone-samplettest">The one-sample <span class="math">\(t\)</span> test</h4>

<ol>
<li>State the test statistic that is used for a one-sample <span class="math">\(t\)</span>-test, and give its sampling distribution when underlying the population is Normal and the null hypothesis is true.</li>
<li>State the left-sided, right-sided, and two-sided rejection regions for the one-sample <span class="math">\(t\)</span> test.</li>
<li>Identify when a left-sided, right-sided, or two-sided rejection region is appropriate to test a given null hypothesis.</li>
<li>Construct a left-sided, right-sided, or two-sided rejection region given a claim about a population and a significance level <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span>.</li>
<li>Determine whether an observed test statistic &#8220;falls in&#8221; a rejection region.</li>
<li>Determine the appropriate tail of the <span class="math">\(t\)</span>-distribution to use to compute a <span class="math">\(P\)</span>-value for a given null hypothesis.</li>
<li>Compute the <span class="math">\(P\)</span>-value for an observed <span class="math">\(t\)</span>-statistic, and use the <span class="math">\(P\)</span>-value to conclude whether or not to reject a given null hypothesis.</li>
