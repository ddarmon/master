<h4 id="matchedpairstprocedures">Matched pairs <span class="math">\(t\)</span> procedures</h4>

<ol>
<li>Define a matched pairs design.</li>
<li>State examples of statistical questions where a matched pairs design would be appropriate.</li>
<li>Describe the setup of a data set collected from a matched pairs design.</li>
<li>State the sampling distribution of the average difference score from a matched pairs design when we assume the population of difference scores is Normally distributed.</li>
<li>State the <span class="math">\(T\)</span>-statistic used in a matched pairs design.</li>
<li>State the sampling distribution of the <span class="math">\(T\)</span>-statistic used in a matched pairs design when we assume the population of difference scores is Normally distributed.</li>
<li>Perform a hypothesis test for a population difference from data fitting a matched pairs design using the appropriate matched pairs <span class="math">\(t\)</span>-test.</li>
<li>Construct a confidence interval for a population difference from data fitting a matched pairs design using the appropriate matched pairs <span class="math">\(t\)</span>-test.</li>
<li>Use <code>one.sample.t.test</code> to test a hypothesis or construct a confidence interval using summary data from a matched pairs design.</li>
<li>Give reasons why we must <strong>carefully identify</strong> whether an independent samples <span class="math">\(t\)</span>-test or matched pairs <span class="math">\(t\)</span>-test is most appropriate for analyzing a data set.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="normalquantileplots">Normal Quantile Plots</h4>

<ol>
<li>Explain why we should check for the Normality of an underlying population before performing any of the <span class="math">\(t\)</span>-tests or constructing any of the <span class="math">\(t\)</span>-based confidence intervals we have developed so far in the class.</li>
<li>Construct a density plot in R from a data set, and diagnose whether the density plot indicates any clear departures from Normality in the underlying population.</li>
<li>Explain, loosely, what a Q-Q plot is showing, and what a &#8220;good&#8221; and &#8220;bad&#8221; Q-Q plot looks like.</li>
<li>Construct a Q-Q plot in R from a data set, and diagnose whether the Q-Q plot indicates any clear departures from Normality in the underlying population.</li>
<li>Given a Q-Q plot, identify whether the Q-Q plot points towards:

<ul>
<li>Normality</li>
<li>Left-skewness</li>
<li>Right-skewness</li>
<li>Heavy tails</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Identify which property of a population, overall, is most problematic to <span class="math">\(t\)</span>-based inferential procedures.</li>
