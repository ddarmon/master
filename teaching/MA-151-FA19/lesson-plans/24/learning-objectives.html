<h4 id="riskandodds">Risk and odds</h4>

<ol>
<li>Define the population risk of a negative outcome.</li>
<li>Define the population odds of a negative outcome.</li>
<li>Compute the sample risk and sample odds given a table summarizing positive and negative outcomes in a sample.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="two-sampleproblems%3Aproportions">Two-sample problems: proportions</h4>

<ol>
<li>Give examples of two-sample problems that involve proportions.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="relativeriskandoddsratios">Relative risk and odds ratios</h4>

<ol>
<li>Define the population relative risk of a negative outcome in a treatment group compared to a control group.</li>
<li>Define the population odds ratio of a negative outcome in a treatment group compared to a control group.</li>
<li>Compute the sample relative risk and sample odds ratio given a two-way table.</li>
<li>State what value of relative risk / odds ratio corresponds to &#8220;no difference&#8221; in risk between the treatment and control populations.</li>
<li>Explain why relative risks and odds ratios are most appropriately considered on a logarithmic scale.</li>
<li>Recognize that odds are not risks, and odds ratios are not relative risks.</li>
<li>Interpret relative risks and odds ratios in terms of whether they indicate the treatment or control condition leads to lower risk.</li>

<ol>
<li>State the four conditions on the count of a categorical variable for it be binomial.</li>
<li>Compute the sample risks, relative risk, and odds ratio from a two-way table using <code>oddsRatio</code> from the <code>mosaic</code> package.</li>
<li>Compute confidence intervals for the population relative risk and odds ratio from a two-way table using <code>oddsRatio</code> from the <code>mosaic</code> package.</li>
<li>Use a confidence interval for either a population relative risk or population odds ratio to test for a difference in risk between a treatment and control population.</li>
