<h1>Study Guide for Final Exam</h1>

<p>This will be a closed-book exam.</p>
	
<p>You are permitted one 8.5 inch by 11 inch sheet of <strong>handwritten</strong> notes (both sides) for the final exam.</p>

<p>You will be allowed to use R on a <strong>school</strong> computer for computations. This means you will not have access to, nor will you need to use, anything beyond Base R (e.g. you will not need to use <tt>mosaic</tt>, <tt>MUsaic</tt>, etc.) for the exam.</p>

<p>You will have 2 hours to complete the exam. The exam will start promptly at 11:35 AM, so please arrive on time.</p>

<p>To do well on the exam, you should be able to do the following:</p>
