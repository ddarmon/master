<h4 id="explanatoryandresponsevariables">Explanatory and response variables</h4>

<ol>
<li>Define explanatory and response variables in terms of their roles in predicting one variable from another.</li>
<li>Given a predictive question about two variables, identify which variable is the explanatory variable and which is the response variable.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="relationshipbetweentwoquantitativevariables%3Ascatterplots">Relationship between two quantitative variables: scatterplots</h4>

<ol>
<li>Interpret a scatter plot showing the relationship between an explanatory variable and response variable in a data set.</li>
<li>Construct a scatter plot from a (small) data set with two quantitative variables.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="addingcategoricalvariablestoscatterplots">Adding categorical variables to scatterplots</h4>

<ol>
<li>Explain how to construct a scatter plot that also includes the value of a categorical variable for each individual in a data set.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="measuringlinearassociation%3Acorrelation">Measuring linear association: correlation</h4>

<ol>
<li>State the formula for the sample covariance and sample correlation.</li>
<li>State the major properties of the sample correlation.</li>
<li>Given a scatter plot, identify whether the sample correlation for the points is positive, negative, or nearly zero.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="nonlinearrelationshipshandout">Nonlinear Relationships (Handout)</h3>

<ol>
<li>Explain why it is sometimes appropriate to transform either the explanatory variable, the response variable, or both, before computing a sample correlation.</li>
