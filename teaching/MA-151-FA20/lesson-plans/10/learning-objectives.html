<h4 id="parametersandstatistics">Parameters and statistics</h4>

<ol>
<li>Compare and contrast a parameter of a population and a statistic of a sample.</li>
<li>Recognize the notation of using Greek letters for parameters and Roman letters for statistics.</li>
<li>Given the description of a statistical problem, identify whether a numerical characteristic is a population parameter or a sample statistic.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="statisticalestimationandsamplingdistributions">Statistical estimation and sampling distributions</h4>

<ol>
<li>Define sampling distribution, and relate it to prior concepts in the course such as random variables, probability distributions, and density curves.</li>
<li>Explain why we can model the statistic of a sample as a random variable when the sample was a simple random sample from a population.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="thesamplingdistributionofbarx">The sampling distribution of <span class="math">\(\bar{X}\)</span></h4>

<ol>
<li>State the mean <span class="math">\(\mu_{\bar{X}}\)</span> of the sample mean <span class="math">\(\bar{X}\)</span> of a simple random sample.</li>
<li>State the standard deviation <span class="math">\(\sigma_{\bar{X}}\)</span> of the sample mean <span class="math">\(\bar{X}\)</span> of a simple random sample.</li>
<li>Explain, using the mean and standard deviation of the sample mean, why averaging values from a simple random sample is a good idea.</li>
<li>Relate the sampling distribution of the sample mean to the concepts of accuracy and precision.</li>
<li>Given a population mean and standard deviation, compute the mean and standard deviation of the sample mean from a simple random sample of the population.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="thecentrallimittheorem">The central limit theorem</h4>

<ol>
<li>State under what conditions the sampling distribution of the sample mean is <strong>exactly</strong> Normal.</li>
<li>State under what conditions the sampling distribution of the sample mean is <strong>approximately</strong> Normal.</li>
<li>Answer probability queries about the sample mean from a simple random sample given the relevant characteristics of the sample and the population.</li>
</ol>
