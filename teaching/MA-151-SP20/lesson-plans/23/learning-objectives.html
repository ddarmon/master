<h4 id="two-waytables">Two-way tables</h4>

<ol>
<li>Explain how a two-way table can be used to summarize counts of a categorical variable across two or more populations.</li>
<li>Give an analogy between one-, two-, and multi-sample tests for population means and a two-way table for testing claims about proportions of a category across one, two, and more than two populations.</li>
<li>State the convention we will use in the class in terms of what rows and columns correspond to in a two-way table.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="hypothesesfortwo-waytablesofcounts">Hypotheses for two-way tables of counts</h4>

<ol>
<li>Explain what we mean by two variables being associated.</li>
<li>Explain what we mean by two variables being independent.</li>
<li>Describe how independence between two variables manifests in a two-way table.</li>
<li>State the generic form of the null and alternative hypotheses about two categorical variables in a population.</li>
<li>Given a problem about two categorical variables, identify the relevant null and alternative hypotheses from the problem.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="expectedcountsandthechi-squarestatistic">Expected counts and the chi-square statistic</h4>

<ol>
<li>Explain under what hypothesis the expected counts for the <span class="math">\(\chi^{2}\)</span> statistic for association are calculated.</li>
<li>State the <span class="math">\(\chi^{2}\)</span> statistic for association.</li>
<li>State the sampling distribution of the <span class="math">\(\chi^{2}\)</span> statistic for association under the null hypothesis.</li>
<li>Construct a matrix from a two-way table using <code>matrix</code> in R.</li>
<li>Compute the <span class="math">\(\chi^{2}\)</span> statistic for association using <code>xchisq.test</code> from <code>mosaic</code>.</li>
<li>Interpret the output of <code>xchisq.test</code> in terms of the <span class="math">\(\chi^{2}\)</span> statistic for association.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="thechi-squaretest">The chi-square test</h4>

<ol>
<li>Interpret the output of <code>xchisq.test</code> in terms of the <span class="math">\(\chi^{2}\)</span> test for association.</li>
<li>Perform a hypothesis test for association using <code>xchisq.test</code>.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="conditionsforthechi-squaretest">Conditions for the chi-square test</h4>

<ol>
<li>State the assumptions on the data for the <span class="math">\(\chi^{2}\)</span> statistic for association to follow a <span class="math">\(\chi^{2}\)</span> distribution.</li>
</ol>
