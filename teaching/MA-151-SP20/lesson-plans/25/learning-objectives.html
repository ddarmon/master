<h4 id="theregressionparameters">The regression parameters</h4>

<ol>
<li>State the assumptions of the Simple Linear Regression with Normal Noise (SLRNN) model.</li>
<li>State the three parameters of the SLRNN model.</li>
<li>Relate the components of the SLRNN model (intercept, slope, errors) to their sample analogs (intercept, slope, residuals).</li>
<li>Explain in what sense the SLRNN model is &#8220;a line plus noise.&#8221;</li>
<li>State the estimator for the standard deviation of the noise term in the SLRNN model.</li>
<li>Identify the estimates for the intercept, slope, and standard deviation of the noise term in an output from <code>summary</code>.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="checkingtheconditionsforinference">Checking the conditions for inference</h4>

<ol>
<li>Use the following four plots to diagnose the validity of the SLRNN model from residuals of a simple linear regression:<br/>
a. A Q-Q plot of the residuals.<br/>
b. A plot of the residuals against the fitted values of the response.<br/>
c. A plot of the squared residuals against fitted values of the response.<br/>
d. A plot of the residuals against the individual index.</li>
<li>Identify which SLRNN model assumption is checked using the four residual plots from the previous learning objective.</li>
<li>Use <code>mplot</code> and <code>gf_line</code> in <code>mosaic</code> to generate residual diagnostic plots from an output from <code>lm</code>.</li>
