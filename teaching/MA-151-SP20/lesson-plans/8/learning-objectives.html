<h3 id="chapter9">Chapter 9</h3>

<h4 id="theideaofprobability">The idea of probability</h4>

<ol>
<li>Explain why we need to talk about chance when we consider a a sample from a simple random sample sampling design.</li>
<li>Define probability in terms of a proportion related to long-run frequencies.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="probabilityrules">Probability rules</h4>

<ol>
<li>State the range of values that a probability can take.</li>
<li>Recognize when a number can and cannot be a probability.</li>
<li>Relate the probability that an event occurs to the probability that the event does not occur.</li>
<li>Characterize the probability of an event between 0 and 1 in terms of whether the event will:

<ul>
<li>always occur</li>
<li>never occur</li>
<li>sometimes occur</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h4 id="randomvariables">Random variables</h4>

<ol>
<li>Explain why some variables are considered &#8220;random&#8221; in statistics, and explain in what sense a random variable is a &#8220;number that could have been otherwise.&#8221;</li>
<li>Give examples of random variables that result from simple random sampling.</li>
<li>Recognize and use the notation of an upper case letter (like <span class="math">\(X, Y,\)</span> or <span class="math">\(Z\)</span>) for a random variable, and a lower case letter (like <span class="math">\(x, y,\)</span> or <span class="math">\(z\)</span>) for a particular value the random variable could take.</li>
<li>Given the definition of a random variable, determine whether the random variable is discrete or continuous.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="discreteversuscontinuousprobabilitymodels">Discrete versus continuous probability models</h4>

<ol>
<li>State the properties of a probability distribution for a discrete random variable, and identify whether a given table can or cannot be a probability distribution.</li>
<li>Use a probability distribution to answer probability queries such as <span class="math">\(P(X > a)\)</span>, <span class="math">\(P(a < X < b)\)</span>, <span class="math">\(P(X \leq a)\)</span>, etc., for a discrete random variable <span class="math">\(X\)</span>.</li>
<li>State the properties of a density curve for a continuous random variable.</li>
<li>Relate the probability that a continuous random variable <span class="math">\(X\)</span> falls in an interval to its probability curve.</li>
<li>Given a rectangular or triangular density curve for a random variable <span class="math">\(X\)</span>, find the probability that <span class="math">\(X\)</span> falls in a given interval.</li>
