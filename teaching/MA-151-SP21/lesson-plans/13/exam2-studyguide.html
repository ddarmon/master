<h1>Study Guide for Exam 2</h1>

<p>This will be a closed-book exam. You will be allowed to use R on a <strong>school</strong> computer for computations. This means you will not have access to, nor will you need to use, anything beyond Base R (e.g. <tt>mosaic</tt>, <tt>MUsaic</tt>, etc.) for the exam.</p>

<p>To do well on the exam, you should be able to do the following:</p>
