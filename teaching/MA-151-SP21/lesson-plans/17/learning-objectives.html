<h4 id="comparingtwopopulationmeans">Comparing two population means</h4>

<ol>
<li>Give examples of scientific questions that would warrant comparisons of two population means.</li>
<li>Recognize the Greek letter <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span>, the Greek analog to the Roman letter <span class="math">\(d\)</span>, which is used to indicate <span class="math">\(\delta\text{ifferences}\)</span> between population parameters.</li>
<li>State a claim about two population means <span class="math">\(\mu_{X}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\mu_{Y}\)</span> as an equality / inequality involving the difference <span class="math">\(\delta = \mu_{X} - \mu_{Y}\)</span> between the population means.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="two-sampletprocedures">Two-sample <span class="math">\(t\)</span> procedures</h4>

<ol>
<li>State the test statistic used in the two-sample <span class="math">\(t\)</span>-test.</li>
<li>Determine, qualitatively, whether an observed test statistic from the two-sample <span class="math">\(t\)</span>-test provides evidence against a null hypothesis.</li>
<li>State the sampling distribution of the test statistic used in the two-sample <span class="math">\(t\)</span>-test, and the assumptions that must hold for that sampling distribution to be correct.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="two-samplet-testsinrlecturenotesforlecture17">Two-sample <span class="math">\(t\)</span>-tests in R (Lecture Notes for Lecture 17)</h4>

<ol>
<li>Interpret the output of <code>two.sample.t.test</code> in <code>MUsaic</code>, including:

<ul>
<li>where <span class="math">\(t_{\text{obs}}\)</span> is reported</li>
<li>where the estimated degrees of freedom for the <span class="math">\(t\)</span>-distribution is reported</li>
<li>where the <span class="math">\(P\)</span>-value for <span class="math">\(t_{\text{obs}}\)</span> is reported</li>
<li>where the confidence interval is reported</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Use <code>two.sample.t.test</code> to perform a two-sample <span class="math">\(t\)</span>-test in R.</li>
<li>Use <code>two.sample.t.test</code> to construct a two-sided confidence interval for the population difference <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span> in R.</li>
<li><strong>Interpret</strong> a two-sided confidence interval for a population difference <span class="math">\(\delta\)</span> <strong>in the context of a given problem</strong>.</li>
