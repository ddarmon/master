<h3 id="chapter4">Chapter 4</h3>

<h4 id="theleast-squaresregressionline">The least-squares regression line</h4>

<ol>
<li>Specify how a regression function is related to the task of predicting one outcome from another.</li>
<li>Specify the form of a simple linear regression of a response variable <span class="math">\(y\)</span> on an explanatory variable <span class="math">\(x\)</span>. Equivalently, identify the form of a simple linear regression model for predicting a response variable <span class="math">\(y\)</span> using a predictor variable <span class="math">\(x\)</span>.</li>
<li>Recall, from either high school or college algebra / precalculus, the equation for a line and the interpretation of the slope and intercept of the line.</li>
<li>Identify the slope and intercept from a simple linear regression model, and interpret the slope and intercept in the context of a prediction problem.</li>
<li>Use a simple linear regression model to predict a response variable at a given value of the predictor.</li>
<li>Determine the residual / error of a prediction given a simple linear regression model, a value for the explanatory variable, and a response variable at that value of the explanatory variable.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="associationdoesnotimplycausation">Association does not imply causation</h4>

<ol>
<li>Give examples where an observed association between two variables does not result from a causal influence from one variable to the other.</li>
<li>Explain the motto &#8220;association does not imply causation,&#8221; or its more popular counterpart &#8220;correlation does not imply causation.&#8221;</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="r">R</h3>

<ol>
<li>Perform a simple linear regression using R.</li>
<li>Relate the output of <code>lm</code> to the slope and intercept of the fitted simple linear regression equation.</li>
</ol>
