<h1> Instructions for Uploading Anki Decks to eCampus </h1>

<p>The following bullets lay out the submission instructions and grading procedure I will use for the Anki decks.

<p>They are a bit draconian, and the tl;dr is this: make sure you are regularly using Anki (at least once per day) and submit your Anki decks before each Wednesday class, and you will receive the full 5% of the course points allotted to pre-class preparation.
<ul>
	<li> New Anki decks will be provided on eCampus at the end of each class session.
		<ul>
			<li>You should load these into your local version of Anki by the end of that day.
		</ul>
	<li> Your Anki decks are to be uploaded to eCampus by 11:30 AM each Wednesday.
		<ul>
			<li>In Anki, use <tt>File > Export... > Export format: Anki Deck Package (*.apkg)</tt> to export your Anki decks.
			<li>Make sure you have <tt>Course Decks::MA 220</tt> selected in <tt>Include:</tt> and the <tt>Include scheduling information</tt> check box is selected.
		</ul>
	<li> After each Wednesday class, I will randomly select 6 students, and review their Anki decks.
		<ul>
			<li> If you are selected, I will review your deck history to make sure you are using Anki regularly, which will determine your grade for that submission.
			<ul>
				<li>If I find you have <strong>not</strong> been using Anki regularly, I may go back and review previous submissions that were not checked.
			</ul>
			<li> If you are not selected, your grade will be determined by whether you submitted your Anki decks.
		</ul>
	<li> You have a 35% chance of being selected each class, and will be selected, on average, 4.5 times over the course of the semester.
</ul>
