<h1> Instructions for Downloading and Uploading Anki Decks to eCampus </h1>

<p>The following bullets lay out the submission instructions and grading procedure I will use for the Anki decks.

<p>They are a bit draconian, and the tl;dr is this:
	
<p><b>tl;dr:</b> Make sure you are regularly using Anki (at least once per day) and submit your Anki decks before each Wednesday class, and you will receive the full 5% of the course points allotted to pre-class preparation.

<h2>Download and Submission Instructions</h2>
<ul>
	<li> New Anki decks will be provided on eCampus at the end of each class session.
		<ul>
			<li>You should load these into your local version of Anki by the end of that day.
		</ul>
	<li> Your Anki decks are to be uploaded to eCampus by 11:30 AM each Wednesday.
		<ul>
			<li>In Anki, use <tt>File > Export... > Export format: Anki Deck Package (*.apkg)</tt> to export all of your Anki decks<sup><a href="#prior">[1]</a></sup>.
			<li>Make sure you have <tt>Course Decks::MA 220</tt> selected in <tt>Include:</tt> and the <tt>Include scheduling information</tt> check box is selected.
			<li>Upload the <tt>*.apkg</tt> file to the appropriate <tt>Anki Deck - Due by Beginning of Lecture _</tt> assignment under <tt>Assessments > Assignments</tt>.
		</ul>
	<li> After each Wednesday class, I will randomly select 6 students, and review their Anki decks.
		<ul>
			<li> <b>If you are selected</b>, I will review your deck history to make sure you are using Anki regularly and appropriately (e.g. not just cruising through "Show Answer > Good" at a breakneck pace for each question<sup><a href="#disclaimer">[2]</a></sup>), which will determine your grade for that submission.
			<ul>
				<li>If I find you have <strong>not</strong> been using Anki regularly and appropriately, I may go back and review previous submissions for which you were not one of the selected students.
			</ul>
			<li> <b>If you are not selected</b>, your grade will be determined by whether you submitted your Anki decks.
		</ul>
	<li> You have a 40% chance of being selected each week, and will be selected, on average, 4.8 times over the course of the semester.
		<ul>
			<li> I provide these statistics for full transparency, <strong>not</strong> to encourage you to try to game the system.
		</ul>
</ul>

<p id="prior"><sup>[1]</sup> If you are already using Anki, good job! Unless you want to share your personal decks with me (I wouldn't recommend it), you can create a separate profile for use with this class by selecting <tt>File > Switch Profile</tt>, and selecting <tt>Add</tt> from the dialog box.</p>
<p id="disclaimer"><sup>[2]</sup> If you can remember everything instantly on the first try, congratulations! But I will expect this at-home performance to be reflected on your homework, quizzes, and exams.</p>
