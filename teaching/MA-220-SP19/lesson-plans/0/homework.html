<p><p><h2>Pre-class Assessments</h2>
<p> Complete the following pre-class assessments, <strong>to be submitted on the first day of class</strong>.<br/>
<p> You are welcome to consult resources such as your calculus textbook, Wikipedia, Khan Academy, YouTube, etc., if you need to review any of the mathematics. However, <strong>you should complete these assessments without consulting other students, tutors, professors, etc.</strong> This assignment will be marked for completeness, and is meant to indicate to both you and me your preparedness for the course.</p>

<p>You can print out the assessments from the linked PDFs, and write your answers directly on the printouts.<br/>
