<h1>Homework 1</h1>

<p><h2>WeBWorK Assignment</h2>
<p>You will receive an email from me via WeBWorK sometime after our first class on Wednesday. Please follow the directions in that email.
	
As part of your first homework, complete HW0 on WeBWorK. This assignment introduces you to WeBWorK. You can find HW0 <a href="https://webwork.monmouth.edu/webwork2/19SP_MA-220-02/HW0">here</a>.

<p><h2>Install <tt>R</tt> on Laptop and Bring to Class on Monday</h2>
<p>We will be using <tt>R</tt> during Monday's class. Before Monday's class, please install <tt>R</tt> <strong>and</strong> RStudio onto your laptop, and bring your laptop to class on Monday. You can find links for installing <tt>R</tt> and RStudio on the main course website <a href = "https://ddarmon.github.io/master/teaching/ma-220-02-SP19.html#R">here</a>.

<p> If you cannot bring a personal laptop to class for any reason, please let me know as soon as possible. We can get <tt>R</tt> working on one of Monmouth's desktop computers if that is the case, but it's much easier to use your own computer.

</ol>

<p> <strong>Problem 2:</strong> For each of the previous two statistical queries, determine the relevant parameter of the population, and a potentially useful statistic of a sample from that population.

	<li> Your favorite color.
</ol>

<p> <strong>Problem 4:</strong> Read the abstracts for each of the linked journal articles. For each study, determine whether the study is observational or experimental. <strong>Explain your decision.</strong> For each study that is observational, does the result imply the causal story ''\(X\) causes \(Y\)''? <strong>Explain.</strong>

<ol type = "a">
	<li> <a href = "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10680-016-9389-x">Happy People Have Children: Choice and Self-Selection into Parenthood</a>

<p> <strong>Problem 5:</strong> For each of the following associations, propose a possible confounder that could explain the observed association.

<ol type = "a">
	<li> Children with larger shoe sizes are scored as having better reading ability.
	<li> Accounting for age (i.e. comparing individuals of the same age), taller men tend to have higher IQs than shorter men.
	<li> Crime rate and ice cream sales are associated over time, with the highest crime rates tending to occur during peak ice cream sales.
	<li> Mortality rate is inversely associated with coffee consumption.
