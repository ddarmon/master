<p><strong>Section 4.1: Probability Density Functions and Cumulative Distribution Functions</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Give examples of quantities that could be modeled using a continuous random variable.</li>
<li>Recognize and explain the correspondence between density histograms for data and probability density functions for random variables.</li>
<li>Given a probability density function <span class="math">\(f\)</span> for a continuous random variable <span class="math">\(X\)</span> and a query region <span class="math">\([a, b]\)</span>, determine <span class="math">\(P(X \in [a, b]) = P(a \leq X \leq b)\)</span> using <span class="math">\(f\)</span>.</li>
<li>State the two sufficient conditions for a function <span class="math">\(f\)</span> to be a valid probability density function, and identify when a given function <span class="math">\(f\)</span> does or does not satisfy these conditions.</li>
<li>Given that a probability density function is proportional to a known function, i.e. <span class="math">\(f(x) = c g(x)\)</span>, determine the constant <span class="math">\(c\)</span> that makes <span class="math">\(f\)</span> a probability density function.</li>
<li>Define the cumulative distribution function of a continuous random variable, and compute the cumulative distribution function using the random variable&#8217;s probability density function.</li>
<li>Specify what additional property, beyond the four properties shared by all cumulative distribution functions, unique to the cumulative distribution function of a continuous random variable.</li>

<p><strong>Section 4.2: Expected Values and Moment Generating Functions</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Define the expected value of a continuous random variable <span class="math">\(X\)</span>, and compute <span class="math">\(X\)</span>&#8217;s expected value given its probability density function.</li>
<li>Recognize the correspondence between sums and probability mass functions for discrete random variables and integrals and probability density functions for continuous random variables.</li>
<li>Compute the expected value of a random variable <span class="math">\(Y = g(X)\)</span> defined through a function <span class="math">\(g\)</span> of a continuous random variable <span class="math">\(X\)</span> with a known probability density function.</li>
<li>Simplify expectations of the form <span class="math">\(E[a X + b]\)</span> and <span class="math">\(E\left[\sum\limits_{j = 1}^{n} g_{j}(X)\right]\)</span> directly, without resorting to the definition of expectation.</li>
<li>Define the variance of a continuous random variable <span class="math">\(X\)</span>, and compute <span class="math">\(X\)</span>&#8217;s variance given its probability density function.</li>
<li>Use the &#8216;variance shortcut&#8217; to compute the variance of a random variable.</li>
<li>Simplify variances (standard deviations) of the form <span class="math">\(\text{Var}(a X + b)\)</span> (<span class="math">\(\sigma_{a X + b}\)</span>) directly, without resorting to the definition of variance (standard deviation).</li>
