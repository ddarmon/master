<p><strong>Section 6.1: Statistics and Their Distributions</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Define a random sample from a population.</li>
<li>Explain why a statistic of a random sample is itself a random variable.</li>
<li>Define the sampling distribution of a statistic.</li>
<li>Given a probability model for how a random sample is generated, construct the sampling distribution of a statistic of that random sample for small sample sizes (<span class="math">\(n = 2\)</span> or <span class="math">\(3\)</span>).</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Section 6.2: The Distribution of the Sample Mean</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Recognize and explain the notation <span class="math">\(X_{1}, X_{2}, \ldots, X_{n} \stackrel{\text{iid}}{\sim} \text{D}\)</span> for a random sample from a population with distribution D.</li>
<li>Compute the mean and variance of the sample mean for a random sample <span class="math">\(X_{1}, X_{2}, \ldots, X_{n} \stackrel{\text{iid}}{\sim} \text{D}\)</span> of size <span class="math">\(n\)</span> from a population with mean <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span> and variance <span class="math">\(\sigma^{2}\)</span>.</li>
<li>Distinguish between the mean and variance of a population and the mean and variance of the sample mean of a random sample from that population.</li>
<li>State the premises (conditions) and conclusion of the Central Limit Theorem.</li>
<li>Explain in what sense the Central Limit Theorem is an <strong>asymptotic</strong> result.</li>
<li>State under what conditions the Central Limit Theorem-based approximation for the sampling distribution of the sample mean works well for small sample sizes.</li>
<li>Use the Central Limit Theorem to approximate the sampling distribution of the sample mean for a random sample from a population with known mean and variance.</li>
<li>Use the Central Limit Theorem to approximate the sample total for a random sample from a population with known mean and variance.</li>
