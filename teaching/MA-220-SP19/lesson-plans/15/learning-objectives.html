<p><strong>Section 7.1: Point Estimation &mdash; General Concepts and Criteria</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Compare and contrast descriptive and inferential statistics in terms of populations/samples and parameters / statistics.</li>
<li>Explain why you can never answer a question about a <strong>population</strong> directly from a sample without making an inference.</li>
<li>State the three main types of inferential procedures we will consider in this course, and describe them in plain English.</li>
<li>Define point estimator, and state what a point estimator is an estimator <strong>for</strong>.</li>
<li>Distinguish between a point estimator (the procedure) and a point estimate (an application of the procedure to a particular sample).</li>
<li>State common point estimators for population parameters, including point estimators for population means, variances, and success probabilities.</li>
<li>Given a collection of point estimators and their expected values and variances, come up with a rough ranking of how &#8220;good&#8221; the point estimators are.</li>
<li>Recognize the statistical notation of using <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span> for a generic parameter of a population, and <span class="math">\(\widehat{\theta}\)</span> for a point estimator of that parameter.</li>
<li>Define the standard error of a point estimator, and compute the standard error of a point estimator given its sampling distribution.</li>
