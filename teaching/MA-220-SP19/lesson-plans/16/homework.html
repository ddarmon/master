<h1>Homework 15</h1>

<h2>Problems</h2>

<p><strong>General Instructions:</strong> For all confidence intervals you compute in these problems, draw a sketch of the confidence interval on the appropriate scale. For example, if you are told that a random sample of 25 individuals from a population whose height has standard deviation \(\sigma = 1 \text{ feet}\) has (sample) mean 6 feet, and are asked to compute a 95% confidence interval for the mean height in the population, then you should also sketch (you do not need the color-coding):

<p><h2>Section 8.1: </h2>
<p> <strong>Note:</strong> For all confidence intervals in this section, you should assume that the population is Gaussian (normal) and the population standard deviation \(\sigma\) is <strong>known</strong>.
<ul>
	<li>1
	<li>2
	<li>3 (be <strong>very careful</strong> in your interpretations)
	<li>4a-d
	<li> 5ab
</ul>
<p><h2>Section 8.3: </h2>
<p> <strong>Note:</strong> For all confidence intervals in this section, you should assume that the population is Gaussian (normal) and the population standard deviation \(\sigma\) is <strong>unknown</strong>.
<ul>
	<li> 29. Use both R and Table A.5 and make sure your answers agree!
	<li> 30. Use both R and Table A.5 and make sure your answers agree!
	<li> 33. You may use R to generate a histogram, compute the sample mean and sample standard deviation, etc.
	<li> 34. You may use R to generate a histogram, compute the sample mean and sample standard deviation, etc.
	<li> 35a. Compute a two-sided confidence interval, rather than a lower confidence bound. We will discuss lower confidence bounds in the next class.
</ul>
