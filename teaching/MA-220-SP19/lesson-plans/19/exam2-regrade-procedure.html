<h1>Procedure for Regrade of Exam 2</h1>

<h3>Rescoring:</h3>

You have the opportunity to earn back half of the points you missed in the in-class version of Exam 2. This means that your maximum possible percentage, based on your Exam 2 Percentage, is
<p>\[\text{Maximum Possible Regrade Percentage} = \text{Exam 2 Percentage} + \frac{(100\% - \text{Exam 2 Percentage})}{2}\]
This is the <strong>most</strong> percentage points you can end with on Exam 2 after submitting Exam 2 for regrade.

<p>Please read the following directions <strong>carefully</strong>.

<h3>Directions for the Regrade of Exam 2:</h3>
<ol>
	<li> You will have 10 minutes to look at your marked Exam 2 sometime during the day on Thursday, April 4. I will be in my office from 9 AM until 11:30 AM, and then from 1 PM until 6 PM. I will then recollect Exam 2.
	<li> I will post a blank copy of Exam 2 on eCampus at 6 PM on Thursday.
	<li> <strong>Due Date and Time:</strong> The take home version of Exam 2 is due <b>at the beginning of class</b> on Monday, April 8. This means you must turn in the take home version of the exam <strong>by the time I close the door at 11:40 AM on Monday</strong>. Late exams will not be accepted under any circumstances.
	<li> <strong>Format:</strong> The take home exam is <strong>open book and open notes</strong>. However, <strong>no collaboration</strong> is allowed, including with your classmates, other students, the Math Learning Center, a private tutor, etc.
	<li> <strong>Grading Policy:</strong> To earn points back on a problem, you must complete <strong>all</strong> parts of the problem, <strong>not just the parts you lost points on</strong>. There will be <strong>no partial credit</strong> per-problem: you must complete an entire problem correctly to receive any points back on that problem.<ul>
		<li> For example, on Problem 1, you must complete parts (a) through (d) correctly to earn back points for Problem 1.
		<li> <strong>Note:</strong> The extra credit for your Exam 2 prediction will be based on your original Exam 2 percentage, not the percentage after including the regrade.
	</ul>
	<li> If, after reading these directions, you are still confused about any part of my policy for the regrade of Exam 2, please see me during office hours or contact me via email.
