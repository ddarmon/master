<h1>Homework 2</h1>

<p><h2>Lab</h2>

Complete the <a href = "lab1.html">Lab 1</a> assignment we started in class. Follow the submission instructions from that assignment.

<p><h2>Problems</h2>

Complete each of the following problems. Submit your solutions &mdash; <strong>stapled</strong> &mdash; at the beginning of class on Wednesday.

<p> <strong>Problem 1:</strong> Read the abstracts for each of the linked journal articles. For each study, determine whether the study is observational or experimental. <strong>Explain your decision.</strong> For each study that is observational, does the result imply the causal story ''\(X\) causes \(Y\)''? <strong>Explain.</strong>

<p> <strong>Problem 2:</strong> For each of the following associations, propose a possible confounder that could explain the observed association.

	<li> Children with larger shoe sizes are scored as having better reading ability.
	<li> Accounting for age (i.e. comparing individuals of the same age), taller men tend to have higher IQs than shorter men.
	<li> Crime rate and ice cream sales are associated over time, with the highest crime rates tending to occur during peak ice cream sales.
	<li> Mortality rate is inversely associated with coffee consumption.
</ol>

<p> <strong>Problem 3:</strong> Construct a rug plot, histogram, and boxplot <strong>by hand</strong> (not using R) for the following two data sets.

Choose the left-endpoint of the left-most bin to be a reasonable integer, and use </strong>at least 3</strong> integer-width bins.

<ol type = "a">
	<li> -0.98, -2.82, -0.05, 1.39, -4.69, 4.97, -4.66, 2.05, -2.60, 1.57
