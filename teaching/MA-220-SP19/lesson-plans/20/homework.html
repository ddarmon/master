<h2>Problems</h2>

<p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Use the test statistic method to test all hypotheses in this homework. Follow the procedure outlined on page 31 of the notes from today's lecture.

<h2>Additional Problem</h2>

<p> Consider a random sample \(X_{1}, X_{2}, \ldots, X_{n} \stackrel{\text{iid}}{\sim} N(\mu, \sigma^{2})\) from a Gaussian population with <strong>known population standard deviation</strong> \(\sigma\). We wish to test the following hypothesis:
\[ \begin{array}{ll} H_{0} : & \mu \leq \mu_{0} \\ H_{a} : & \mu > \mu_{0}\end{array}\]
at significance level \(\alpha\).

<ol>
	<li> <strong>Test Statistic Method:</strong>
	<ol>
	<li> Determine an appropriate test statistic for this hypothesis test.
	<li> Determine the rejection region for the appropriate test statistic for this hypothesis test.
	</ol>
	<li> <strong>Confidence Interval Method:</strong>
	<ol>
	<li> Determine the confidence bound that can be used to test this hypothesis. Denote the true value of \(\mu\) by \(\mu_{0}\).
	<li> Determine the condition for rejecting the null hypothesis using the confidence bound.
	</ol>
	<li> Show that the interval of values of \(\bar{x}\) for which the <strong>Test Statistic Method</strong> rejects the null hypothesis is equivalent to the interval of values for which the <strong>Confidence Interval Method</strong> rejects the null hypothesis.
		<ul>
			<li> <strong>Hint:</strong> For each of the two methods, write the interval of values for which the null hypothesis is rejected as an inequality involving \(\mu_{0}\) and \(\bar{x}\). Then show that the two inequalities specify the same interval of values for \(\bar{x}\).
