<p><strong>Section 9.1: Tests of a Hypothesis Based on a Single Sample</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Identify the two types of errors that we can make while performing a statistical hypothesis test with regards to rejecting / not rejecting the null hypothesis.</li>
<li>Give the standard names for the two types of errors from the previous learning objective.</li>
<li>Define the Type I and Type II error rates of a hypothesis testing procedure.</li>
<li>State which of the two error rates we control by fixing <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> for a hypothesis test.</li>
<li>Explain the analogy between Type I and Type II errors and convictions in the US criminal justice system.</li>
<li>Define test statistic.</li>
<li>Explain how the three test statistics from Sections 9.2 and 9.3 measure the discrepancy between the null hypothesis and the data.</li>
<li>Distinguish between a test statistic, which gives the procedure for testing a statistical hypothesis, and the observed test statistic, which is the application of that procedure to a particular sample.</li>
<li>Define the rejection region of a statistical hypothesis test.</li>
<li>Explain the rationale behind the procedure for constructing the rejection region for a hypothesis test of significance level <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span>.</li>
<li>Construct rejection regions for one-sided and two-sided alternative hypotheses.</li>
<li>State and follow the &#8220;hypothesis testing recipe&#8221; given a claim about a population to test.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Section 9.2: Tests About a Population Mean</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>State an appropriate test statistic to test a claim about the population mean of a Gaussian population with <strong>known</strong> population standard deviation.</li>
<li>State an appropriate test statistic to test a claim about the population mean of a Gaussian population with <strong>unknown</strong> population standard deviation.</li>
<li>Identify when the <span class="math">\(Z\)</span> or <span class="math">\(T\)</span> statistics are appropriate to test a claim about the mean of a population.</li>
<li>Perform a level <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> hypothesis test for a claim about a population mean.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Section 9.3: Tests Concerning a Population Proportion</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>State an appropriate test statistic to test a claim about the success probability / population proportion from a binomial experiment.</li>
<li>Identify when the <span class="math">\(Z\)</span> statistic is appropriate to test a claim about the success probability of a binomial experiment.</li>
<li>Perform a level <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> hypothesis test for a claim about a binomial success probability or population proportion.</li>
