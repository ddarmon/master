<h1>Homework 22</h1>

<h2>Problems</h2>

<p><strong>Instructions:</strong> 
	<ol>
		<li>Use R to compute all sample statistics, \(P\)-values, and confidence intervals.
			<ul>
				<li> The x and y values are given below, <strong>so you do not have to type them in by hand.</strong> Use copy-and-paste.
			</ul>
		<li>Report a confidence interval or confidence bound (appropriate to the hypotheses under consideration) for the population correlation coefficient \(\rho_{X, Y}\) for the first three problems, and comment on (a) how precisely the population correlation coefficient has been estimated and (b) what the confidence interval indicates about the <strong>direction</strong> (positive or negative) and <strong>strength</strong> (weak or strong) of the linear association.
		<li>For problems that ask for a scatter plot, generate the scatter plot using R, print out the scatter plot, and attach the scatter plot to your homework.
		<li>For problems that ask you to perform a hypothesis test, you should <strong>follow the full 7-step procedure</strong> of stating the claim, determining the null and alternative hypotheses, etc.
	</ol>

			<li>For Part d, generate a scatter plot using R, print the scatter plot, and attach to your homework. You do not need to construct normal probability plots.
