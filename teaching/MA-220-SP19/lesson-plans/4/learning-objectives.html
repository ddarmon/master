<p><strong>Section 2.1: Sample Spaces and Events</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Define an experiment, outcome, and sample space in the context of the mathematical model of an experiment.</li>
<li>State the sample space of an experiment given a verbal description of the experiment.</li>
<li>Compare and contrast discrete and continuous sample spaces.</li>
<li>Define an event in the context of the mathematical model of an experiment.</li>
<li>Describe what it means for an event to occur.</li>
<li>State meaning of set-union <span class="math">\(\cup\)</span>, set-intersect <span class="math">\(\cap\)</span>, and set-complement <span class="math">\('\)</span> from set theory.</li>
<li>Use a Venn diagram to reason about set operations.</li>
<li>State the meaning of set-union <span class="math">\(\cup\)</span>, set-intersect <span class="math">\(\cap\)</span>, and set-complement <span class="math">\('\)</span> when applied to events.</li>
<li>State what it means for two sets / events to be disjoint / mutually exclusive.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Section 2.2: Axioms, Interpretations, and Properties of Probability</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Define a set function and give examples from earlier courses in mathematics.</li>
<li>State the three axioms that a set function must satisfy to be a probability set function.</li>
<li>Compute probabilities of events defined using set operations using the results derived from the three axioms of probability theory.</li>
<li>Define a simple event and use simple events to compute the probability of a non-simple event.</li>
