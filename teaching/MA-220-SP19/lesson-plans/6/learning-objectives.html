<ol>
<li>State the General Principle of Counting, and use the General Principle of Counting to determine the number of outcomes from a described procedure.</li>
<li>Compute the number of permutations of size <span class="math">\(k\)</span> from a set of <span class="math">\(n\)</span> distinct objects given a description of a process that results in such permutations.</li>
<li>Compute the number of combinations of size <span class="math">\(k\)</span> from a set of <span class="math">\(n\)</span> distinct objects given a description of a process that results in such combinations.</li>
</ol> -->

<p><strong>Section 2.5: Independence</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>State the rough intuition behind independence of two events.</li>
<li>State the four equivalent conditions needed for two events to be independent.</li>
<li>Use independence, in addition to the previous probability rules (addition rule, multiplication rule, complementation rule, etc.), to find the probability of a compound event.</li>
<li>Distinguish between independent and mutually exclusive events.</li>
<li>State the conditions that must be met for a collection of <span class="math">\(n\)</span> events to be mutually independent.</li>
