<li>State the probability mass function and cumulative distribution function for a geometric random variable.</li>
<li>Use R to simulate a geometric variable.</li>
<li>Describe how a probability histogram represents a probability mass function, and construct a probability histogram given a probability mass function and vice versa.</li>
<li>Relate probability histograms to the other histograms we have learned in class: frequency, relative frequency, and density histograms.</li>
