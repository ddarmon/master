<p><strong>Section 3.3: Expected Values of Discrete Random Variables</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Define the expected value of a discrete random variable <span class="math">\(X\)</span>, and compute <span class="math">\(X\)</span>&#8217;s expected value given its probability mass function.</li>
<li>Give a frequency interpretation of the expected value of a random variable <span class="math">\(X\)</span>.</li>
<li>Recognize the convention of using Greek letters for parameters of a random variable, and their Roman counterpart for statistics of a sample. For example, <span class="math">\(\sigma\)</span> for the standard deviation of a random variable and and <span class="math">\(s\)</span> for the standard deviation of a sample.</li>
<li>Compute the expected value of a random variable <span class="math">\(Y = g(X)\)</span> defined through a function <span class="math">\(g\)</span> of a random variable <span class="math">\(X\)</span> with a known probability mass function.</li>
<li>Simplify expectations of the form <span class="math">\(E[a X + b]\)</span> and<br/>
<span class="math">\(E\left[\sum\limits_{j = 1}^{n} g_{j}(X)\right]\)</span> directly, without resorting to the definition of expectation.</li>
<li>Define the variance of a discrete random variable <span class="math">\(X\)</span>, and compute <span class="math">\(X\)</span>&#8217;s variance given its probability mass function.</li>
<li>Define the standard deviation of a random variable.</li>
<li>Use the &#8216;variance shortcut&#8217; to compute the variance of a random variable.</li>
<li>Simplify variances (standard deviations) of the form <span class="math">\(\text{Var}(a X + b)\)</span> (<span class="math">\(\sigma_{a X + b}\)</span>) directly, without resorting to the definition of variance (standard deviation).</li>
