Complete each of the following problems. Submit your solutions &mdash; <strong>stapled</strong> &mdash; at the beginning of class on Monday.

<p> <strong>Problem 1:</strong> For each of the following statistical queries, determine whether the collection of items described is the population, a sample from the population, or neither.

<ol type = "a">
	<li> How many active professional American football players suffer from <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_traumatic_encephalopathy">chronic traumatic encephalopathy</a>?
	<ol type = 'i'>
		<li> Current members of the New York Giants

		<li> All workers in the US
		<li> All males and females reporting their income to the IRS
		<li> Male and female workers at Google
		<li> Male and female workers interviewed by Gallup
	</ol>
</ol>

<p> <strong>Problem 2:</strong> For each of the previous two statistical queries, determine the relevant parameter of the population, and a potentially useful statistic of a sample from that population.

<p> <strong>Problem 3:</strong> For each of the following measurements, determine whether the measurement is quantitative or qualitative, <strong>and</strong> if quantitative, whether it is discrete or continuous.

<ol type = "a">
	<li> The number of current citizens of the United States.

	<li> The brand of a razor.
	<li> The lifespan of an individual born in the 1980s.
	<li> Your favorite color.
</ol>

<!-- <p> <strong>Problem 4:</strong> Read the abstracts for each of the linked journal articles. For each study, determine whether the study is observational or experimental. <strong>Explain your decision.</strong> For each study that is observational, does the result imply the causal story ''\(X\) causes \(Y\)''? <strong>Explain.</strong>

<ol type = "a">
	<li> <a href = "https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10680-016-9389-x">Happy People Have Children: Choice and Self-Selection into Parenthood</a>

</ol>

<p> <strong>Problem 5:</strong> For each of the following associations, propose a possible confounder that could explain the observed association.

<ol type = "a">
	<li> Children with larger shoe sizes are scored as having better reading ability.
	<li> Accounting for age (i.e. comparing individuals of the same age), taller men tend to have higher IQs than shorter men.
	<li> Crime rate and ice cream sales are associated over time, with the highest crime rates tending to occur during peak ice cream sales.
	<li> Mortality rate is inversely associated with coffee consumption.
