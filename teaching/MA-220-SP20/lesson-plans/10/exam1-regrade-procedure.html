<h1>Procedure for Regrade of Exam 1</h1>

<h3>Rescoring:</h3>

You have the opportunity to earn back 1/4 of the points you lost on the in-class version of Exam 1. This means that your maximum possible percentage, based on your Exam 1 Percentage, is
<p>\[\text{Maximum Possible Regrade Percentage} = \text{Exam 1 Percentage} + \frac{(100\% - \text{Exam 1 Percentage})}{4}\]
This is the <strong>most</strong> percentage points you can end with on Exam 1 after submitting Exam 1 for regrade.

<p>Please read the following directions <strong>carefully</strong>.

<h3>Directions for the Regrade of Exam 1:</h3>
<ol>
	<li> You may stop by my office at any point between now and March 2nd to see your marked exam. You can look at your exam in my office, and ask me any questions you have about how a problem was graded.
	<li> You will receive a blank copy of Exam 1 at the end of class on Wednesday, February 26.
	<li> <strong>Due Date and Time:</strong> The take home version of Exam 1 is due <b>at the beginning of class</b> on Monday, March 2. Late exams will not be accepted under any circumstances.
		<ul>
		<li> If you would like to turn in the take home exam early, you can hand me the exam during any of my office hours on Thursday or Monday.
		</ul>
	<li> <strong>Format:</strong> The take home exam is <strong>open book and open notes</strong>. However, <strong>no collaboration</strong> is allowed, including with your classmates, other students, the Math Learning Center, a private tutor, etc.
	<li> <strong>Grading Policy:</strong> To earn points back on a problem, you must complete <strong>all</strong> non-bonus parts of the problem, <strong>not just the parts you lost points on</strong>. There will be <strong>no partial credit</strong> per-problem: you must complete an entire problem correctly to receive any points back on that problem.<ul>
		<li> For example, on Problem 1, you must complete parts (a) through (c) correctly to earn back points for Problem 1.
		<li> <strong>Note:</strong> You will not receive any points back for completing the bonus parts.
		<li> <strong>Note:</strong> The extra credit for your Exam 1 prediction will be based on your original Exam 1 percentage, not the percentage after including the regrade.
	</ul>
	<li> If, after reading these directions, you are still confused about any part of my policy for the regrade of Exam 1, please see me during office hours or contact me via email.
