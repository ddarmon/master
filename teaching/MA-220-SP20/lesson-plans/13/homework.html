<h1>Homework 12</h1>

<h2>Additional Directions</h2>

<p> For each of the following problems:
	
	<ol>
		<li> Sketch the probability density function of the Gaussian random variable (i.e. get the general shape and placement of the probability density function correct).
		<li> Indicate the area under the curve that you are computing to answer the given probability query.
		<li> Use R to compute the probability, and give the R command you used.
	</ol>

<p><b>Example:</b> If \(X \sim N(1, 2^{2})\), and you are asked to compute \(P(0 \leq X \leq 2)\),
you should sketch:

<p><center><img src = "pdf-example.jpg" width = 500x></img></center>
<p>as well as state and find \[ \begin{aligned} P(0 \leq X \leq 2) &= P(X \leq 2) - P(X \leq 0) \\ &= \texttt{pnorm(2, mean = 1, sd = 2) - pnorm(0, mean = 1, sd = 2)} \end{aligned} \]

<p><b>Notice:</b> I have marked the horizontal axis with \(\mu \pm k \sigma\) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, 3\).

<p><b>Hint:</b> You may find <a href="https://ddarmon.shinyapps.io/normal-area-demo/">this Shiny demo</a> useful as you get familiar with the Gaussian curve and using R to compute Gaussian probabilities. <a href="https://ddarmon.shinyapps.io/normal-probability-queries-practice/">This Shiny app</a> will generate practice problems you can work through and then check your work.

<h2>Problems</h2>

<p><h3>Section 4.3: </h3>
<ul>
	<li>39</b>
	<li>43; for this problem use <tt>pnorm</tt> with arguments <tt>mean = 0</tt> and <tt>sd = 1</tt>. This means you need to <b>standardize</b> \(X\) <b>first</b>.
	<li>44</b>
</ul>

<p> Read pages 178-180 (up to but not including "Nonstandard Normal Distributions") and page 183 (up to but not including "The Normal Distribution and Discrete Populations") in Devore & Berk about percentiles of the Gaussian (normal) distribution, and solve the following problems.
