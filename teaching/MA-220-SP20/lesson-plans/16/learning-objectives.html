<p><strong>Section 8.1: Basic Properties of Confidence Intervals</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Determine the margin of error for the sample mean from a Gaussian population with known standard deviation <span class="math">\(\sigma\)</span> at a confidence level <span class="math">\(c\)</span>.</li>
<li>Recognize the relationship between a confidence level <span class="math">\(c\)</span> and tail value <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span>, and state how these specify the probability in the tails or body of a given distribution.</li>
<li>Determine the critical value <span class="math">\(z_{\alpha}\)</span> for a standard Gaussian random variable using both Table A.3 and R&#8217;s <tt>qnorm</tt>.</li>
<li>Define interval estimator and confidence interval, and make an analogy between them and point estimators and point estimates.</li>
<li>Construct a <span class="math">\(c = 1 - \alpha\)</span> confidence interval for a population mean <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span> using a random sample from a Gaussian population when the population standard deviation <span class="math">\(\sigma\)</span> is known.</li>
<li>Sketch the confidence interval from the previous learning objective.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Section 8.3: Intervals Based on a Normal Population Distribution</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Give a constructive definition of a <span class="math">\(t\)</span>-distributed random variable <span class="math">\(T\)</span> using a random sample from a Gaussian population.</li>
<li>Determine the parameter of a <span class="math">\(t\)</span>-distributed random variable <span class="math">\(T\)</span> constructed using a random sample from a Gaussian population.</li>
<li>Describe the general properties of the probability density function of a <span class="math">\(t\)</span>-distributed random variable as compared to a standard Gaussian random variable including where each is centered, the symmetry properties of each, and the &#8220;fatness&#8221; of the tails of each.</li>
<li>Determine the critical value <span class="math">\(t_{\alpha, \nu}\)</span> for a random variable <span class="math">\(T\)</span> that is <span class="math">\(t\)</span>-distributed with parameter <span class="math">\(\nu\)</span> using both Table A.5 and R&#8217;s <tt>qt</tt>.</li>
<li>Construct a <span class="math">\(c = 1 - \alpha\)</span> confidence interval for a population mean <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span> using a random sample from a Gaussian population when the population standard deviation <span class="math">\(\sigma\)</span> is unknown.</li>
<li>Sketch the confidence interval from the previous learning objective.</li>
<li>Reason about what confidence interval we have covered, if any, is appropriate for the population mean given a description of a sample from that population.</li>
