<p><strong>Section 8.1: Basic Properties of Confidence Intervals</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Give the correct interpretation of the confidence level <span class="math">\(c\)</span> associated with an interval estimator, and explain what is wrong with some common <strong>mis</strong>interpretations of confidence intervals.</li>
<li>Explain how the width of a confidence interval for the population mean of a Gaussian population with known standard deviation \(\sigma\) varies as you change:

<ul>
<li>the confidence level <span class="math">\(c\)</span>;</li>
<li>the sample size <span class="math">\(n\)</span>; or</li>
<li>the population standard deviation <span class="math">\(\sigma\)</span>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Construct confidence level <span class="math">\(c\)</span> confidence upper bounds and lower bounds for a population mean <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span> for a Gaussian population with both <strong>known</strong> and <strong>unknown</strong> population standard deviation <span class="math">\(\sigma\)</span>.</li>
<li>Sketch confidence level <span class="math">\(c\)</span> upper bounds and lower bounds for a population mean <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span> for a Gaussian population with both <strong>known</strong> and <strong>unknown</strong> population standard deviation <span class="math">\(\sigma\)</span>.</li>
<li>Relate the form of confidence upper / lower bounds for a population mean to the endpoints of the two-sided confidence interval for the same mean.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Section 8.2: Large Sample Confidence Intervals for a Population Mean and Proportion</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Identify when a &#8216;word problem&#8217; asks for a confidence interval for a population proportion and/or a success probability from a binomial experiment.</li>
<li>State the standardization of the success proportion <span class="math">\(\widehat{p}_{n} = X/n\)</span> used in constructing Wilson's confidence interval, and explain why this standardized variable approximately follows a standard Gaussian distribution.</li>
<li>Use the <tt>binom.test()</tt> function to compute Wilson's confidence interval for a population proportion.</li>
<li>Sketch confidence level <span class="math">\(c\)</span> confidence intervals, confidence upper bounds, and confidence lower bounds for a population proportion based on Wilson's confidence interval.</li>
<li>Distinguish between &#8216;word problems&#8217; that call for the use of:

<ul>
<li><span class="math">\(\bar{x}_{n} \pm z_{\alpha/2} \cdot \sigma / \sqrt{n}\)</span>;</li>
<li><span class="math">\(\bar{x}_{n} \pm t_{\alpha/2, n-1} \cdot s / \sqrt{n}\)</span>;</li>
<li>Wilson's confidence interval; or</li>
<li>none of the above<br/>
</li>
</ul>or their upper / lower bound equivalents.</li>
