<p><strong>Section 10.1: <span class="math">\(z\)</span> Tests and Confidence Intervals for a Difference Between Two Population Means</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Distinguish between inferential questions about a single population and about two populations.</li>
<li>Given a claim about two population, identify relevant population parameters and state the claim as an equality / inequality involving the population parameters.</li>
<li>State a point estimator for the difference between two population means, given a sample from each population.</li>
<li>Determine the mean and variance of the point estimator <span class="math">\(D = \bar{X} - \bar{Y}\)</span>.</li>
<li>Compute the mean and variance of sums and differences of two or more independent random variables.</li>
<li>Determine the distribution of the sum or difference of two independent Gaussian random variables.</li>
<li>State the <span class="math">\(Z\)</span>-statistic for a two-sample test for the difference between two population means, including its sampling distribution under the null hypothesis when the populations are Gaussian.</li>
<li>Construct confidence intervals and upper/lower confidence bounds for the difference between two population means when the population standard deviations are known.</li>
<li>Perform a hypothesis test for a claim about the difference between two population means when the population standard deviations are known.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Section 10.2: The Two-Sample <span class="math">\(t\)</span> Test and Confidence Interval</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>State the <span class="math">\(T\)</span>-statistic for a two-sample test for the difference between two population means, including its approximate sampling distribution under the null hypothesis when the populations are Gaussian.</li>
<li>Construct confidence intervals and upper/lower confidence bounds for the difference between two population means when the population standard deviations are unknown.</li>
<li>Perform a hypothesis test for a claim about the difference between two population means when the population standard deviations are unknown.</li>
<li>Use the R function <tt>two.sample.t.test()</tt> to perform a two-sample <span class="math">\(t\)</span>-test using summarized data.</li>
