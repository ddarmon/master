<h1>Study Guide for Final Exam</h1>

<p>This will be an open-book, open-notes final exam.</p>

<p>You will need a calculator. A calculator that performs arithmetic operations, reciprocals, square roots, powers and logarithms (base 10) is sufficient. Graphing calculators are permitted.</p>

<p>You will have 2 hours to complete the exam. The exam will start promptly at 11:35 AM, so please start on time.</p>

<p>There will be 7 questions on the exam: 3 modeled after problems from the previous exams, and 4 from the material covered since Exam 2.</p>

<p>To do well on the new material on the exam, you should be able to do the following:</p>
