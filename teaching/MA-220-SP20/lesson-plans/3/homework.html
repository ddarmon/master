<h2>Problems</h2>

<b>Note:</b> For each of the following problems, you can either compute the requested statistics by-hand, or use R. I recommend using R, and saving all of your work in an R Notebook.

<p><b>Example:</b> Suppose you were asked to compute the mean of the numbers: 1, 2, 3.

<p> In R, you would first store these numbers in a vector <tt>x</tt> using:

<p><code>x = c(1, 2, 3)</code>

<p> The '<tt>c</tt>' is short for 'concatenate,' and tells R to combine all of the values you pass as arguments into a single vector. 

<p>Then compute the mean of <tt>x</tt> using:

<p><code>mean(x)</code>
