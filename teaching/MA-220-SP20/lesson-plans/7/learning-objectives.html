<p><strong>Section 3.1: Random Variables</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Give the definition of a random variable as a function from a sample space to the real numbers.</li>
<li>Properly use the convention of denoting a random variable by an uppercase Roman letter (e.g. <span class="math">\(X, Y, Z\)</span>), a particular value that random variable can take by the corresponding lowercase Roman letter (e.g. <span class="math">\(x, y, z\)</span>), and its range by the corresponding calligraphic Roman letter (e.g. <span class="math">\(\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{Y}, \mathcal{Z}\)</span>).</li>
<li>Distinguish between a discrete random variable and a continuous random variable.</li>
<li>Explain in what sense a random variable is a &#8216;&#8216;number that could have been otherwise.&#8217;&#8217;</li>
<li>Given a sample space and a description of a random variable, determine the range of the random variable, and determine what values of the sample space map to each value of the random variable&#8217;s range.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Section 3.2: Probability Distributions for Discrete Random Variables</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Define the probability mass function <span class="math">\(p(x) = P(X = x)\)</span> for a random variable <span class="math">\(X\)</span> in terms of the underlying sample space <span class="math">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span>.</li>
<li>State the two characteristics a function <span class="math">\(p\)</span> must have to be a valid probability mass function, and identify when a given function <span class="math">\(p\)</span> does or does not satisfy these conditions.</li>
<li>Use a probability mass function <span class="math">\(p\)</span> to compute the probability <span class="math">\(P(X \in Q)\)</span> that <span class="math">\(X\)</span> falls in some query set <span class="math">\(Q \subseteq \mathbb{R}\)</span>.</li>
<li>Use the &#8220;Probability Dictionary&#8221; to map from statements such as &#8220;at least <span class="math">\(x\)</span>,&#8221; &#8220;at most <span class="math">\(x\)</span>,&#8221; etc., to the corresponding query set <span class="math">\(Q\)</span>.</li>
<li>Define the cumulative distribution function <span class="math">\(F(x) = P(X \leq x)\)</span> for a random variable <span class="math">\(X\)</span> in terms of the underlying sample space <span class="math">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span>.</li>
<li>State the four properties a function <span class="math">\(F\)</span> must have to be a valid cumulative distribution function.</li>
<li>Define what it means for a function <span class="math">\(f\)</span> to be continuous and right-continuous.</li>
<li>Sketch the graph of a cumulative distribution function <span class="math">\(F\)</span> for a discrete random variable <span class="math">\(X\)</span> given either its <span class="math">\(p\)</span> or <span class="math">\(F\)</span>.</li>
<li>Compute <span class="math">\(F\)</span> from <span class="math">\(p\)</span>, and vice versa.</li>
<li>Compute the probability <span class="math">\(P(a < X \leq b)\)</span> of a standard query using <span class="math">\(F\)</span>.</li>
<li>Compute the probability <span class="math">\(P(a \square X \square b)\)</span> of a non-standard query using <span class="math">\(F\)</span>.

<ul>
<li><strong>Hint:</strong> Recall the mnemonic relating <span class="math">\(P(a \square X \square b)\)</span> to the standard query <span class="math">\(P(a < X \leq b)\)</span>.</li>
</ul></li>
