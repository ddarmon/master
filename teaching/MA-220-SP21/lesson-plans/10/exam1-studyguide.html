<h1>Study Guide for Exam 1</h1>

<h2>Exam Format</h2>

<p>This will be a closed-book, closed-notes exam. You will need a calculator. A calculator that performs arithmetic operations, reciprocals, square roots, powers and logarithms (base 10) is sufficient. Graphing calculators are permitted.</p>

The exam will consist of 6 problems, 5 of which will be open-ended and 1 of which will be multiple choice. All open-ended problems will be multi-part.

<h2>Advice for Preparing for the Exam</h2>

This is a mathematics exam. As such, you will be expected to <strong>do mathematics</strong>. A common misconception made by students is that, in preparing for a mathematics exam, it suffices to make sure you can understand the solution to a given problem <strong>with the solution in front of you</strong>. The exam, however, tests your ability to <strong>solve the problem yourself from scratch</strong>. Thus, you should practice solving problems from scratch in preparation for the exam. The homework and quizzes are part of this practice, but only completing those once will likely not lead to a strong performance on the exam.

<p>With the ultimate goal of solving problems yourself from scratch in mind, a possible study check list is below:
<ol>
	<li> Make sure you can correctly answer all of the Anki cards I provided, and any additional Anki cards you made. If you are still unclear on the material on any of the Anki cards, <strong>see me</strong>.
	<li> Exam questions will be modeled off of in-class examples, homework problems, and quiz problems. As such, go through homework and quiz problems, <strong>especially those you found difficult or that were marked as incorrect / incomplete</strong>, and make sure you can solve them from scratch, <strong>without the solution in front of you.</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>I have provided blank copies of all of the quizzes on eCampus so you can re-solve a given problem from scratch.
		<li>Since problems on the exam will not come tagged with the chapter / section relevant to their solutions, you might try solving the quiz and homework problems in a random order. If you would like help with this, I can show you how to construct a randomized list of problems using R.
	</ul>
	<li> Review the compilation of learning objectives below, and make sure you can perform each action below <strong>without your notes or book</strong>. If there is a particular learning objective you are unclear on, <strong>email or see me</strong>.
	<li><strong>Cramming</strong> (studying right before the exam) combined with <strong>massed practice</strong> (solving lots of problems all at once) is an <strong>ineffective</strong> study strategy. Instead, <strong>distribute</strong> your study sessions <strong>over the remaining time until the exam</strong>. Study for at most 60 to 90 minutes at a time, and <strong>take breaks</strong>, whether legitimate breaks (go for a walk, hang out with friends, etc.), or a transition to studying for another course. The sooner before the exam you start studying, the better.
</ol>

<p>To do well on the exam, you should be able to do the following:</p>
