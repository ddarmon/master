<h1>Homework 16</h1>

<h2>Problems</h2>

<p><h2>Section 8.2: </h2>

<p><strong>General Instructions:</strong> For all confidence intervals (confidence bounds) you compute in these problems, draw a sketch of the confidence interval (confidence bound) on the appropriate scale. <ul>
	<li>For population means, determine reasonable lower and upper values for the population mean and sketch the interval between those values.
	<li>For population proportions, always sketch the interval on a scale from 0 to 1.
</ul>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Make sure you know what population parameter you are finding a confidence interval for. If the question asks about a mean, you are interested in \(\mu\). If the question asks about a count, proportion, or percentage calculated from \(n\) trials, you are interested in \(p\).

<p> <strong>Note 1:</strong> For confidence intervals (confidence bounds) for a population mean, <strong>do not</strong> use the 'large sample confidence interval' given by equation 8.8 on page 386. Use the \(t\)-distribution-based confidence interval (confidence bound).
<p> <strong>Note 2:</strong> For confidence intervals (confidence bound) for a population proportion, compute the confidence interval (confidence bound) using <tt>prop.test()</tt> as we did in class. <strong>You do not have to do this by hand. Use R.</strong>
