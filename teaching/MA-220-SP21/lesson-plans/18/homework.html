<p><h2>Section 9.2: </h2>

<p><strong>Instructions:</strong> 
	<ol>
		<li>You should test all hypotheses using the confidence interval-based method we developed in class. <strong>For this homework</strong>, do not use the test statistic-based method presented in Chapter 9.
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Reminder:</strong> "significance level" or "level" of a test is a synonym for \(\alpha\).
			</ul>
		<li>You should sketch all confidence intervals, and include the null parameter value in your sketch.
		<li>Be careful to distinguish between when you should uze a \(z\)-based or \(t\)-based interval. 
		<li>Be careful to distinguish between when you should use a confidence interval, upper confidence bound, or lower confidence bound to test the hypothesis.
	</ol>
