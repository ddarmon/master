<p><strong>Section 9.1: Tests of a Hypothesis Based on a Single Sample</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Define a statistical hypothesis test.</li>
<li>State what types of quantities are of interest in statistical hypothesis tests.</li>
<li>Given a claim stated in words, determine a relevant population parameter related to the claim, and write the claim as an equality / inequality in terms of that population parameter.</li>
<li>Explain what the null and alternative hypotheses correspond to in a hypothesis test.</li>
<li>Given a claim stated in words, determine whether the claim is a null hypothesis or an alternative hypothesis, and determine the complementary claim.</li>
<li>Explain the main approach of a hypothesis test as finding evidence either for or against each of the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis.</li>
<li>Define the Type I Error Rate of a hypothesis test.</li>
<li>Define the significance level (&#8216;level&#8217;) of a hypothesis test.</li>
<li>Relate the Type I Error Rate of a hypothesis test to the confidence level of an interval estimator used to test the hypothesis.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Section 9.2: Tests About a Population Mean</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>State and perform the procedure for testing a pair of hypotheses of the form <span class="math">\(H_{0} : \mu = \mu_{0}\)</span> vs. <span class="math">\(H_{a} : \mu \neq \mu_{0}\)</span> using a confidence interval.</li>
<li>State and perform the procedure for testing a pair of hypotheses of the form <span class="math">\(H_{0} : \mu \leq \mu_{0}\)</span> vs. <span class="math">\(H_{a} : \mu > \mu_{0}\)</span> using a confidence bound.</li>
<li>State and perform the procedure for testing a pair of hypotheses of the form <span class="math">\(H_{0} : \mu \geq \mu_{0}\)</span> vs. <span class="math">\(H_{a} : \mu < \mu_{0}\)</span> using a confidence bound.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Section 9.3: Tests Concerning a Population Proportion</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>State and perform the procedure for testing a pair of hypotheses of the form <span class="math">\(H_{0} : p = p_{0}\)</span> vs. <span class="math">\(H_{a} : p \neq p_{0}\)</span> using a confidence interval.</li>
<li>State and perform the procedure for testing a pair of hypotheses of the form <span class="math">\(H_{0} : p \leq p_{0}\)</span> vs. <span class="math">\(H_{a} : p > p_{0}\)</span> using a confidence bound.</li>
<li>State and perform the procedure for testing a pair of hypotheses of the form <span class="math">\(H_{0} : p \geq p_{0}\)</span> vs. <span class="math">\(H_{a} : p < p_{0}\)</span> using a confidence bound.</li>
