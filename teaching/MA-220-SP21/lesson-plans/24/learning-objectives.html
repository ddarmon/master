<p><strong>Section 12.5: Correlation</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>State examples of paired data.</li>
<li>Construct a scatter plot by-hand for a (small) data set of paired data.</li>
<li>Construct a scatter plot in R using <tt>plot()</tt>.</li>
<li>Define the sample covariance, and explain why it quantifies linear association between two outcomes.</li>
<li>Define the sample correlation, and relate the sample correlation to the sample covariance.</li>
<li>State the main properties of the sample correlation in terms of its range, invariance to affine transformations of the data, and symmetry in <span class="math">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math">\(Y\)</span>.</li>
<li>Define the population covariance and population correlation.</li>
<li>State the assumptions made on the population used in constructing the hypothesis tests and confidence intervals presented in this section for the population correlation.</li>
<li>State the null and alternative hypotheses for a claim about a population correlation.</li>
<li>State a test statistic for testing a claim about a population correlation, including its sampling distribution under the null hypothesis when the population is bivariate Gaussian.</li>
<li>Test a claim about a population correlation by either constructing a rejection region or computing a <span class="math">\(P\)</span>-value for an appropriate test statistic.</li>
<li>Use <tt>cor.test()</tt> and interpret its output to perform hypothesis tests or construct (approximate) confidence intervals / bounds for a population correlation.</li>
