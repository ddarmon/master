<p><strong>General Note:</strong> Below, where it says &#8216;define the [statistic] of a data set,&#8217; this means you should <strong>know the procedure</strong> for computing a given statistic, and be able to express that procedure as a mathematical expression. Generally, you will not be expected to compute sample means, medians, variances, etc., by hand, but I do expect you to <strong>know how to</strong> compute them by hand.</p>

<p><strong>Section 1.2: Pictorial and Tabular Methods in Descriptive Statistics</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Construct a frequency, relative frequency, or density histogram given a (small) data set.</li>
<li>Compare and contrast frequency, relative frequency, and density histograms in terms of how they represent the distribution of a data set on the real line.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Section 1.3: Measures of Location</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Define the sample mean of a data set, and specify how we will denote the sample mean.</li>
<li>Explain how the sample mean is related to the &#8216;center of mass&#8217; of a data set.</li>
<li>Define the sample median of a data set.</li>
<li>Compare and contrast the sample mean and sample median in terms of what sense of &#8216;center&#8217; of a data set they summarize.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Section 1.4: Measures of Variability</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Define the sample variance and sample standard deviation of a data set, and specify how we will denote the sample variance and sample standard deviation.</li>
<li>Explain why the sample standard deviation is more interpretable than the sample variance.</li>
<li>Define the mean absolute deviation of a data set.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>R:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Construct a vector <tt>x</tt> in R containing a list of numbers.</li>
<li>Compute the mean, median, variance, and standard deviation of a data set using R.</li>
</ol>
