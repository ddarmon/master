<p><strong>Section 2.4: Conditional Probability</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Define the conditional probability of an event <span class="math">\(A\)</span> given an event <span class="math">\(B\)</span>: <span class="math">\(P(A \mid B)\)</span></li>
<li>Identify conditional probabilities using keywords such as <strong>if</strong> and <strong>given</strong>.</li>
<li>Explain how a conditional probability is a regular probability with a reduced sample space.</li>
<li>State and use the product rule to factor probabilities of events constructed as intersections (&#8220;ANDs&#8221;) of other events.</li>
