<p><strong>Section 2.4: Conditional Probability</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Define a partition of a set.</li>
<li>Define a partition of a sample space.</li>
<li>State the Law of Total Probability, and use the law to solve problems given the relevant information.</li>
<li>State Bayes&#8217; Theorem, and use Bayes&#8217; Theorem to solve problems given the relevant information.</li>
<li>Construct a tree diagram as a visual representation of the product rule for outcomes that occur in stages, and use tree diagrams to reason about the probabilities of sequences of events.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Section 2.5: Independence</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>State the rough intuition behind independence of two events.</li>
<li>State the four equivalent conditions needed for two events to be independent.</li>
<li>Use independence, in addition to the previous probability rules (addition rule, multiplication rule, complementation rule, etc.), to find the probability of a compound event.</li>
<li>Distinguish between independent and mutually exclusive events.</li>
<li>State the conditions that must be met for a collection of <span class="math">\(n\)</span> events to be mutually independent.</li>
