<p><h2>Active Recall with Spaced Retrieval Primer</h2>
<p> The following pages have great introductions to techniques for memorization. If you are time-constrained, the first page should get you 90% of the way towards understanding the technique of active recall with spaced retrieval practice. I read the second article in my junior year of college, and I have used these techniques ever since.</p>

<h3>Questions</h3>

Here are some questions to ask yourself as you read Nicky Case's comic:

<ol>
<li>What are two of the most common ways that students study material in courses? Why are these methods less effective than using active recall with spaced retrieval practice?</li>
<li>What happens to the rate of decay of a memory each time you retrieve a memory? That is, if the chance you remember something after time <span class="math">\(t\)</span> from last actively recalling it decays as <span class="math">\(S(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}\)</span>, what happens to <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span> after each active retrieval?</li>
<li>Sketch what the forgetting curve with well-spaced reviews looks like.</li>
<li>What spaced repetition software does Nicky Case mention?</li>
<li>What are three keys to making flashcards effective?</li>
<li>When could you incorporate flashcards into your day without much additional effort?</li>
