<h1> Instructions for Downloading and Uploading Anki Decks to eCampus </h1>

<p>The following bullets lay out the submission instructions and grading procedure I will use for the Anki decks.
	
<p><b>tl;dr:</b> Make sure you are regularly using Anki (at least once per day) and submit your Anki decks before each Tuesday class, and you will receive the full proportion of course points allotted to pre-class preparation.

<h2>Download and Submission Instructions</h2>
<ul>
	<li> New Anki decks will be provided on eCampus at the end of each lecture on new material.
		<ul>
			<li>You should load these into your local version of Anki by the end of that day.
		</ul>
	<li> Your Anki decks are to be uploaded to eCampus by 01:00 PM each Tuesday.
		<ul>
			<li>In Anki, use <tt>File > Export... > Export format: Anki Deck Package (*.apkg)</tt> to export all of your Anki decks<sup><a href="#prior">[1]</a></sup>.
			<li>In Anki, use <tt>File > Export... > Export format: Anki Collection Package (*.colpkg)</tt> to export all of your Anki decks<sup><a href="#prior">[1]</a></sup>.
			<li>Upload the <tt>*.colpkg</tt> file to the appropriate <tt>Anki Deck - Due by Beginning of Lecture _</tt> assignment under <tt>Assessments > Assignments</tt>.
		</ul>
	<li> After each Tuesday class, I will review your Anki decks.
		<ul>
			<li> I will review your deck history to make sure you are using Anki regularly and appropriately (e.g. not just cruising through "Show Answer > Good" at a breakneck pace for each question<sup><a href="#disclaimer">[2]</a></sup>), which will determine your grade for that submission.
		</ul>
</ul>

<p id="prior"><sup>[1]</sup> If you are already using Anki, good job! Unless you want to share your personal decks with me (I wouldn't recommend it), you can create a separate profile for use with this class by selecting <tt>File > Switch Profile</tt>, and selecting <tt>Add</tt> from the dialog box.</p>
<p id="disclaimer"><sup>[2]</sup> If you can remember everything instantly on the first try, congratulations! But I will expect this at-home performance to be reflected in class.</p>
