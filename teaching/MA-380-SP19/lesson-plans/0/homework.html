<h3>Questions</h3>

<ol>
<li>What are two of the most common ways that students study material in courses?</li>
<li>Who was the first scientist to perform an experiment involving spaced repetition and the testing effect?</li>
<li>What happens to the rate of decay of a memory each time you retrieve a memory? That is, if the chance you remember something after time <span class="math">\(t\)</span> from last actively recalling it decays as <span class="math">\(S(t) = 1 - e^{-\lambda t}\)</span>, what happens to <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span> after each active retrieval?</li>
<li>Sketch what the forgetting curve with well-spaced reviews looks like.</li>
<li>What spaced repetition software does Nicky Case mention that we will be using throughout our course?</li>
<li>What are three keys to making flashcards effective?</li>
<li>When do you plan to use Anki each day?</li>

<p><p><h2>Pre-class Reflection</h2>
<p> Complete the following reflection, <strong>to be submitted on the first day of class</strong>.<br/>

<p> Write a brief (one paragraph) reflection on why you decided to enroll in this course. Some potential reasons, to be expanded on in your reflection:

<ul>
	<li> I am interested in becoming an actuary because ...
	<li> I am interested in learning more about the mathematics behind actuarial science because ...
	<li> I am interested in learning more about probability and statistics because ...
	<li> I like learning new math, and ...
</ul>

This is by no means an exhaustive list; feel free to write about any reason that comes to mind.
