<p><strong>Chapter 5: Calculus and Probability</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Define the expectation of a function of a continuous random variable, and compute such expectations using elementary techniques from integral calculus (<span class="math">\(u\)</span>-substitution, integration by parts, etc.).</li>
<li>Recognize the direct correspondence between differences and sums for discrete random variables and derivatives and integrals for continuous random variables.</li>
<li>State the &#8216;survival function trick&#8217; for computing the expectation of a continuous random variable, and recognize problems where this trick is appropriate.</li>
<li>Define the mode of a continuous random variable, and determine the mode using techniques for optimizing functions of a single variable.</li>
<li>Recognize the shortcut to finding a mode on Exam P.</li>
<li>Define the <span class="math">\(100p\)</span>-th percentile of a continuous random variable, and determine the <span class="math">\(100p\)</span>-th percentile given either the random variable&#8217;s probability density function or cumulative distribution function.</li>
<li>Recognize the shortcut to finding a percentile on Exam P.</li>
<li>Distinguish between discrete, continuous, and mixed-type random variables in terms of the properties of their respective cumulative distribution functions.</li>
<li>Sketch the graph of a cumulative distribution function for a mixed-type random variable, and indicate where the mass for probability atoms lies in the graph.</li>
<li>State the basic form for a random variable defined as the mixture of two random variables, and state its cumulative distribution function and expected value.</li>
