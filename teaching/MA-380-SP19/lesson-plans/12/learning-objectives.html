<ol>
<li>Explain a toy model for insurance that includes a deductible <span class="math">\(d\)</span> and cap <span class="math">\(u\)</span> in terms of how much the insurance company and customer each have to pay for a claim of size <span class="math">\(X\)</span>.</li>
<li>Define the total loss, payment, and uncovered loss in the context of a toy model for insurance.</li>
<li>Express the payment <span class="math">\(Y\)</span> as a function of the total loss <span class="math">\(X\)</span> when a plan:

<ul>
<li>has a deductible <span class="math">\(d\)</span> and no cap</li>
<li>has a cap <span class="math">\(u\)</span> and no deductible</li>
<li>has a deductible <span class="math">\(d\)</span> and a cap <span class="math">\(u\)</span></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Express the uncovered cost <span class="math">\(Z\)</span> as a function of the total loss <span class="math">\(X\)</span> when a plan:

<ul>
<li>has a deductible <span class="math">\(d\)</span> and no cap</li>
<li>has a cap <span class="math">\(u\)</span> and no deductible</li>
<li>has a deductible <span class="math">\(d\)</span> and a cap <span class="math">\(u\)</span></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Relate the total loss, payment, and uncovered loss algebraically.</li>
<li>Compute the expected value of the total loss, payment, and uncovered cost given a distribution for the total loss.</li>
<li>Explain why the payment and uncovered loss can be mixed-type random variables when the total loss is a continuous random variable.</li>
<li>Define the moment generating function <span class="math">\(M_{X}(t)\)</span> for a random variable <span class="math">\(X\)</span> as an expectation and in terms of its probability mass / density function.</li>
<li>Compute the <span class="math">\(k\)</span>-th non-central moment <span class="math">\(E[X^{k}]\)</span> of a random variable <span class="math">\(X\)</span> using its moment generating function.</li>
<li>Given the moment generating function <span class="math">\(M_{X}(t)\)</span> for a random variable <span class="math">\(X\)</span>, determine the moment generating function <span class="math">\(M_{Y}(t)\)</span> for an affine transformation <span class="math">\(Y = a X + b\)</span> of <span class="math">\(X\)</span>.</li>
<li>Given the moment generating functions <span class="math">\(M_{X}(t)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(M_{Y}(t)\)</span> for <strong>independent</strong> random variable <span class="math">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math">\(Y\)</span>, determine the moment generating function <span class="math">\(M_{Z}(t)\)</span> for their sum <span class="math">\(Z = X + Y\)</span>.</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27HÃ´pital%27s_rule">L&#8217;Hopital&#8217;s rule</a> to evaluate a moment generating function or its derivatives at a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classification_of_discontinuities#Removable_discontinuity">removable discontinuity</a> at <span class="math">\(t = 0\)</span>.</li>
