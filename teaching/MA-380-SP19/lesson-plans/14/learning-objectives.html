<p><strong>Chapter 6: Some Continuous Distributions</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>State the probability density and cumulative distribution functions for a continuous uniform random variable <span class="math">\(X\)</span> on <span class="math">\((a, b)\)</span>, and state its mean and variance in terms of <span class="math">\((a, b)\)</span>.</li>
<li>Compare and constrast the moments of the discrete and continuous uniform distributions.</li>
<li>State the probability density, cumulative distribution, and moment generating functions for an exponential random variable <span class="math">\(X\)</span> with parameter <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span>, and state its mean and variance.</li>
<li>Use the tabular method to perform integration by parts.</li>
<li>State the memoryless property for the exponential distribution, and recognize how this property can simplify computations that involve self-conditional conditioning.</li>
<li>State the probability density and moment generating functions for a Gamma random variable <span class="math">\(X\)</span> with parameters <span class="math">\((\alpha > 0, \lambda > 0)\)</span>, and state its mean and variance.</li>
<li>State the definition of the Gamma function <span class="math">\(\Gamma(z)\)</span>, and evaluate the Gamma function for positive integers.</li>
<li>Relate the Gamma function to the factorial function.</li>
<li>Give a constructive definition of a Gamma random variable in terms of exponential random variables, and use this constructive definition to compute the mean, variance, and moment generating function of a Gamma random variable.</li>
<li>Relate the cumulative distribution function for a Gamma random variable with <span class="math">\(\alpha = n \in \mathbb{N}_{> 0}\)</span> to the survival function for a Poisson random variable with a related parameter.</li>
<li>Explain the correspondence between a Bernoulli process, a geometric random variable, and a negative binomial random variable for events occurring on a discrete clock and a Poisson process, an exponential random variable, and a Gamma random variable for events occurring on a continuous clock.</li>
