<p><strong>Chapter 7: Multivariate Distributions</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Explain how a random vector <span class="math">\(\mathbf{X}\)</span> is a vector-valued function from a sample space to a subset of <span class="math">\(\mathbb{R}^{d}\)</span>.</li>
<li>Recognize the notation I will use for vectors: either bold-faced Roman letters (in printed material) or underlined Roman letters (on the board).</li>
<li>State the definition of a discrete random vector.</li>
<li>Define the joint probability mass function <span class="math">\(p(x, y)\)</span> for a bivariate random vector <span class="math">\((X, Y)\)</span>.</li>
<li>Use the joint probability mass function <span class="math">\(p(x, y)\)</span> to find the probability that <span class="math">\((X, Y)\)</span> falls in some query set.</li>
<li>State the two properties that a function <span class="math">\(p(x, y)\)</span> must have to be a joint probability mass function.</li>
<li>Define the joint cumulative distribution function <span class="math">\(F(x, y)\)</span> for a bivariate random vector <span class="math">\((X, Y)\)</span>.</li>
<li>Use the joint cumulative distribution function <span class="math">\(F(x, y)\)</span> to find the probability that <span class="math">\((X, Y)\)</span> falls in a <strong>rectangular</strong> query set.</li>
<li>State the main properties of a joint cumulative distribution function <span class="math">\(F(x, y)\)</span> for a bivariate random vector <span class="math">\((X, Y)\)</span>.</li>
<li>Define the marginal probability mass functions <span class="math">\(p_{X}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(p_{Y}\)</span> for a bivariate random vector <span class="math">\((X, Y)\)</span>.</li>
<li>Explain why marginal probability mass functions are called &#8220;marginal.&#8221;</li>
<li>Compute marginal probability mass functions from a joint probability mass function.</li>
<li>Compute marginal cumulative distribution functions from a joint cumulative distribution function.</li>
<li>Define the expected value <span class="math">\(E[g(X, Y)]\)</span> of a transformation <span class="math">\(g\)</span> of a discrete random vector <span class="math">\((X, Y)\)</span>, and compute the expected value given a probability mass function for the random vector.</li>
<li>State the main properties of expectations of transformations of discrete random vectors in terms of linearity and single-component expectations.</li>
<li>Use a TI&#8211;30XS calculator (or equivalent) to quickly compute product expectations such as <span class="math">\(E[XY]\)</span> given the probability mass function for a bivariate random vector <span class="math">\((X, Y)\)</span>.</li>
