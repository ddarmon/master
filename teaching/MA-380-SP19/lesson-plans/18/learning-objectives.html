<li>Define the joint probability density function <span class="math">\(f(x, y)\)</span> for a bivariate random vector <span class="math">\((X, Y)\)</span>.</li>
<li>Use the joint probability density function <span class="math">\(f(x, y)\)</span> to find the probability that <span class="math">\((X, Y)\)</span> falls in some query set.</li>
<li>State the two properties that are sufficient for a function <span class="math">\(f(x, y)\)</span> to be a joint probability density function.</li>
<li>Define the joint cumulative distribution function <span class="math">\(F(x, y)\)</span> for a bivariate continuous random vector <span class="math">\((X, Y)\)</span>.</li>
<li>Define the marginal probability density functions <span class="math">\(f_{X}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(f_{Y}\)</span> for a bivariate continuous random vector <span class="math">\((X, Y)\)</span>.</li>
<li>Explain why marginal probability density functions are called &#8220;marginal.&#8221;</li>
<li>Compute marginal probability density functions from a joint probability density function.</li>
<li>Compute the joint probability density function of a bivariate random vector <span class="math">\((X, Y)\)</span> from its joint cumulative distribution function.</li>
<li>Define the expected value <span class="math">\(E[g(X, Y)]\)</span> of a transformation <span class="math">\(g\)</span> of a continuous random vector <span class="math">\((X, Y)\)</span>, and compute the expected value given a probability density function for the random vector.</li>
