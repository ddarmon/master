<li>State the definition of the conditional probability mass / density functions of a random vector <span class="math">\((X, Y)\)</span>.</li>
<li>Compute conditional probability mass / density functions given the the joint probability mass / density function of a random vector <span class="math">\((X, Y)\)</span>.</li>
<li>State, in words, the type of question answered by probability mass / density functions.</li>
<li>Given a scatter plot of <span class="math">\((x, y)\)</span> points, roughly indicate the shape of the conditional probability density functions for the random vector <span class="math">\((X, Y)\)</span> that might model those points.</li>
<li>Explain how a joint probability mass / density function for a random vector <span class="math">\((X, Y)\)</span> can be &#8220;factored&#8221; in terms of its marginal and conditional probability mass / density functions.</li>
<li>Give the equivalent conditions for the independence of two random variables <span class="math">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math">\(Y\)</span>.</li>
<li>State the necessary condition on the range of a random vector <span class="math">\((X, Y)\)</span> for the random variables <span class="math">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math">\(Y\)</span> to be independent.</li>
<li>State the definition of mutual independence for <span class="math">\(n\)</span> random variables <span class="math">\(X_{1}, X_{2}, \ldots, X_{n}\)</span>.</li>

<li>Define and compute the conditional expectations of <span class="math">\(X\)</span> given <span class="math">\(Y = y\)</span> and <span class="math">\(Y\)</span> given <span class="math">\(X = x\)</span> for both discrete and continuous random vectors.</li>
<li>Define and compute the conditional variance of <span class="math">\(X\)</span> given <span class="math">\(Y = y\)</span> and <span class="math">\(Y\)</span> given <span class="math">\(X = x\)</span> for both discrete and continuous random vectors.</li>
<li>Given a scatter plot of <span class="math">\((x, y)\)</span> points, sketch the functions <span class="math">\(E[Y \mid X = x]\)</span> and <span class="math">\(E[X \mid Y = y]\)</span>.</li>
<li>Given a scatter plot of <span class="math">\((x, y)\)</span> points, sketch the functions <span class="math">\(\text{Var}(Y \mid X = x)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\text{Var}(X \mid Y = y)\)</span>.</li>
