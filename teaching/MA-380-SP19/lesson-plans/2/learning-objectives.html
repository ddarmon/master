<p><strong>Chapter 2: General Rules of Probability</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>State the three main mathematical objects used in probability theory.</li>
<li>State the three axioms of probability theory.</li>
<li>Relate intersection, union, and complementation to logical statements &#8220;AND&#8221;, &#8220;INCLUSIVE OR&#8221;, and &#8220;NOT&#8221;.</li>
<li>Use Venn diagrams to reason about events and their probabilities.</li>
<li>State the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle for <span class="math">\(n\)</span> events, and use the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle to compute probabilities of unions of events.</li>
<li>State the definitions of conditional probability.</li>
<li>Recognize conditional probability problems from &#8216;of those,&#8217; &#8216;given that,&#8217; and other key words.</li>
<li>Use repeated applications of the definition of conditional probability to &#8216;factor&#8217; the probability of the intersection of events.</li>
<li>State what it means for a collection of <span class="math">\(k\)</span> events to be (mutually) independent, and use this independence to simplify probability calculations.</li>
<li>State what it means for a collection of sets to form a partition of some superset.</li>
<li>State the law of total probability, and sketch a Venn diagram where the law of total probability applies.</li>
<li>Use Bayes&#8217; Theorem to &#8216;flip&#8217; the direction of conditioning.</li>
