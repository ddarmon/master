<ol>
<li>State the law of total expectation (aka iterated expectations).</li>
<li>Explain why <span class="math">\(M_{Y \mid X} = \mu_{Y \mid X}(X)\)</span> is a random variable, and describe &#8216;what remains random.&#8217;</li>
<li>Use iterated expectations to determine the expected value of <span class="math">\(Y\)</span> when we know how <span class="math">\(Y \mid X = x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(X\)</span> are distributed.</li>
<li>State the law of total variation.</li>
<li>Explain why <span class="math">\(V_{Y \mid X} = \sigma^{2}_{Y \mid X}(X)\)</span> is a random variable, and describe &#8216;what remains random.&#8217;</li>
<li>Define the covariance between two random variables <span class="math">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math">\(Y\)</span> in terms of an expectation.</li>
<li>State the &#8216;variance shortcut&#8217; for computing the covariance between two random variables <span class="math">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math">\(Y\)</span> in terms of an expectation.</li>
<li>Compute the covariance between two discrete (continuous) random variables.</li>
<li>Explain what the covariance characterizes about the distribution of a random vector <span class="math">\((X, Y)\)</span>.</li>
<li>State the covariance between two random variables <span class="math">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math">\(Y\)</span> when <span class="math">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math">\(Y\)</span> are independent.</li>
<li>Answer: does zero covariance imply independence?</li>
<li>Determine <span class="math">\(\text{Var}(a X + b Y)\)</span> when <span class="math">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math">\(Y\)</span> are <strong>not independent</strong>.</li>
<li>Define the (Pearson) correlation between two random variables <span class="math">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math">\(Y\)</span> in terms of the covariance and variances of <span class="math">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math">\(Y\)</span>.</li>
<li>Define the mean vector <span class="math">\(\mu_{\mathbf{X}}\)</span> and variance-covariance matrix <span class="math">\(\mathbf{V}\)</span> for a random vector <span class="math">\(\mathbf{X} = (X_{1}, X_{2}, \ldots, X_{d})\)</span>.</li>
<li>Use the variance-covariance matrix <span class="math">\(\mathbf{V}\)</span> for a random vector <span class="math">\(\mathbf{X} = (X_{1}, X_{2}, \ldots, X_{d})\)</span> to determine the variance of a linear combination of <span class="math">\(\mathbf{X}\)</span> using linear algebra.</li>
