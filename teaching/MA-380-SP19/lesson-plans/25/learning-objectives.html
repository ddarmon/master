<ol>
<li>Use the CDF method to find the distribution of a nonlinear transformation <span class="math">\(Z = g(X, Y)\)</span> of a random vector <span class="math">\((X, Y)\)</span> with known probability density function.</li>
<li>Construct a continuous random variate <span class="math">\(X\)</span> with a non-uniform distribution <span class="math">\(F_{X}\)</span> from a continuous random variate <span class="math">\(U\)</span> with a uniform distribution on <span class="math">\((0, 1)\)</span>.</li>
<li>Give a derivation of the inverse function theorem using the chain rule.</li>
<li>Find the range of a random vector <span class="math">\((Z, W) = \mathbf{g}(X, Y)\)</span> that is a transformation of a random vector <span class="math">\((X, Y)\)</span> with known range by &#8220;mapping boundaries&#8221;.</li>
<li>Find the distribution of a linear combination <span class="math">\(Z = a X + b Y\)</span> of the components of a random vector <span class="math">\((X, Y)\)</span> via the introduction of an auxiliary random variable <span class="math">\(W = X\)</span> or <span class="math">\(W = Y\)</span> and then marginalization.</li>
