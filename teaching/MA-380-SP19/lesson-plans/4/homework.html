<p><h1>Chapter 3</h1>
<p><h2>Required:</h2>
<p> <b>I.</b> Complete the following 7 problems:
<ul>
	<li>Exercise 3-8, p. 94
	<li>Exercise 3-15, p. 99
	<li>Exercise 3-27, p. 109
		<ul>
			<li> For (a), use both the direct definition of the expected value of \(X\) and the survival function trick. See <b>II.</b> below for the survival function trick.
		</ul>
	<li>Exercise 3-29, p. 110
		
	<li>Sample Exam Problem 3-2, p. 128
	<li>Sample Exam Problem 3-5, p. 129
	<li>Sample Exam Problem 3-14, p. 131
</ul>

<p> <b>II.</b> Prove the survival function trick for discrete random variables:

<p><b>Theorem:</b> Let \(N\) be a nonnegative discrete random variable with finite mean. Then
\[ E[N] = \sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} P(N > n).\]

<p><b>Hints:</b>
<ul>
	<li> This theorem is easiest to prove by starting from the right-hand side.
	<li> Start by expanding \(P(N > n)\) in terms of the probability mass function of \(N\).
	<li> It will be useful to write each expanded term on a single line, and align the different lines based on the probability mass function terms in a term's expansion.
</ul>

<p> <b>III.</b> Prove the following property for a discrete random variable \(X\) with finite mean.
	
<p><b>Theorem:</b> Let \(X\) be a random variable with mean \(E[X]\), and let \(a, b\) be real (non-random) constants. Then
\[E[a X + b] = a E[X] + b.\]

<p><b>Hint:</b>
<ul>
	<li> Use the result for the expectation of a function \(g\) of a random variable \(X\), and take advantage of properties of sums and probability mass functions.
</ul>

<p> <b>IV.</b> Complete <b>two</b> problems from Problem Solving Session 1 <b>that you did not solve during the problem solving session and that were not presented by the student presenters</b>.
