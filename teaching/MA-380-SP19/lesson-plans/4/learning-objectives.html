<p><strong>Chapter 3: Discrete Random Variables</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Define a random variable in terms of the probability theory we developed in Chapter 2, in particular noting that a random variable is a <strong>function</strong> from the sample space to the real line.</li>
<li>Correctly use the notation of uppercase Roman letters (<span class="math">\(X, Y, Z\)</span>) for random variables, lowercase Roman letters (<span class="math">\(x, y, z\)</span>) for values in the range of a random variable, and calligraphic Roman letters (<span class="math">\(\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{Y}, \mathcal{Z}\)</span>) for the range of a random variable.</li>
<li>State what requirement is placed on the range of a discrete random variable.</li>
<li>Define the probability mass function of a discrete random variable both in terms of an event from the underlying sample space and in how it is commonly used.</li>
<li>Specify the requirements on a function for it to correspond to the probability mass function of some discrete random variable.</li>
<li>Define the cumulative distribution function of a discrete random variable both in terms of an event from the underlying sample space and in how it is commonly used.</li>
<li>Specify the four main properties of a cumulative distribution function.</li>
<li>Given a probability mass function, compute the corresponding cumulative distribution function, and vice versa.</li>
<li>Define the expectation of a function of a discrete random variable.</li>
<li>Recognize how to decompose the expectation of a linear combination in terms of the linear combination of the expectations.</li>
<li>State the &#8216;survival function trick&#8217; for computing an expectation, and recognize problems where this trick is appropriate.</li>
<li>Define the variance of a discrete random variable.</li>
<li>Compute the variance of a discrete random variable using the &#8216;variance shortcut.&#8217;</li>
<li>State how to decompose the variance of <span class="math">\(a X + b\)</span> in terms of the variance of <span class="math">\(X\)</span>.</li>
<li>State how to standardize a random variable using its mean and standard deviation.</li>
<li>State definition of the coefficient of variation.</li>
<li>State Markov&#8217;s and Chebyshev&#8217;s inequalities.</li>
