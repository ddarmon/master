<p><h1>Chapter 3</h1>
<p> <b>I.</b> Complete the following 3 problems:
<ul>
	<li>Exercise 3-36, p. 118
	<li>Exercise 3-40, p. 119
		
	<li>Sample Exam Problem 3-16, p. 132
</ul>

<p> <b>II.</b> Read and digest Section 3.7 (pp. 126-128) on probability generating functions, and create Anki cards summarizing the main results about probability generating functions.

<p> <b>Pointer:</b> If you would like to typeset any of the equations for your cards directly into Anki using <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTeX</a> and are unfamiliar with LaTeX, please see me for a quick tutorial. You might also find the tutorial <a href = "https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Mathematical_expressions">here</a> useful.

<p> <b>III.</b> Evaluate the following sum or series:

<ol>
<li>\(\sum\limits_{n = a}^{b} n,\) where \(a, b \in \mathbb{Z}, a < b\)
<!-- <li>\(\sum\limits_{n = 0}^{\infty} e^{-\lambda} \frac{\lambda^{n}}{n!}, \lambda > 0 \) -->
<!-- <li> \(\sum\limits_{n = 0}^{\infty} e^{tn} e^{-\lambda} \frac{\lambda^{n}}{n!}, \lambda > 0 \) -->
<li>\(\sum\limits_{n = 1}^{\infty} (1-p)^{n-1} p, p \in [0, 1]\)
</ol>

<!-- <p> <b>IV.</b> Derive the power series expansion of \(\frac{1}{1 + x^{2}}\) using (a) Taylor's formula directly and (b) a substitution in a known power series. -->

<p> <strong>IV.</strong> Read about power series and Taylor series in your favorite calculus textbook. Any calculus textbook will do, and they all have a chapter with a title along the lines of "infinite sequences and series." If you do not have a favorite calculus textbook, here are some free options:
	<ul>
	<li><a href = "https://activecalculus.org">Active Calculus</a>
	<li><a href = "http://www.apexcalculus.com/downloads/">Apex Calculus</a>
	<li><a href = "https://www.whitman.edu/mathematics/multivariable/">Community Calculus</a>
	</ul>
<p> Write one page of notes on Taylor series, explaining how to derive a Taylor series from a given differentiable function. Then find the Taylor series expansion of the following functions
	<ol>
		<li> \(e^{x}\)
		<li> \(\sin x\)
		<li> \(\frac{x}{1 - x}\)
	</ol>

<p> <b>V.</b> Complete <b>two</b> problems from Problem Solving Session 2 and <b>one</b> problem from Problem Solving Session 1 <b>that you did not solve during the problem solving session and that were not presented by the student presenters</b>.
