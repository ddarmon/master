<p> Complete the following 6 problems:
<ol>
	<li>Problem 3.2
	<li>Problem 3.3a-d
		<ul>
			<li> For part d, just plot a normal probability plot.
		</ul>
	<li>Problem 3.7a-d
		<ul>
			<li> For part a, use a dot plot instead of a stem-and-leaf plot.
			<li> For part d, follow directions for 3.3d above.
		</ul>
	<li>Problem 3.8a-d
		<ul>
			<li> Same as directions for Problem 3.7.
		</ul>

			<li> <b>Hint:</b> See the comment at the bottom of page 106 of the textbook.
		</ul>
</ol>

<p><h1>Additional Directions:</h1>
	
<p>For each problem that involves a data set, also plot the the diagnostic plots using:

<code>
<p>par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
<br>plot(lm.out, which = c(1:3))
<br>acf(lm.out$residuals)
</code>

<p>and comment on whether they indicate deviations (or not) from the SLRGN model.
