<h1>Homework 4</h1>

<p><h1>Chapter 2</h1>
<p> Repeat your analysis from Homework 3 for the following 4 problems:
<ol>
	<li>Problem 2.4ab
	<li>Problem 2.6ac
	<li>Problem 2.27c
	<li>Problem 2.30ab
</ol>
<p>using both SLRGN-based (as you did in Homework 3) and bootstrap-based inferential statistics.
<p><h3>Directions</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Use \(B = 5000\) bootstrap samples.
	<li>For a problem that asks for a confidence interval, compute the confidence interval <strong>and</strong> the confidence curve under both the SLRGN and bootstrap models.
	<li>Comment on the difference (or not) in your conclusions using the SLRGN versus bootstrap models.
	<li>Refer back to your diagnostic plots for these data sets from Homework 2, and comment on whether the SLRGN- or bootstrap-based inferential statistics are more appropriate for each data set.
</ol>

<p><strong>Hint:</strong> You can add a new confidence curve to a previously plotted confidence curve by passing the argument <tt>add = TRUE</tt> to the new call to <tt>plot.confcurve</tt>.

<p><h1>Additional Problems</h1>

<h2>Duality Between Confidence Intervals and Hypothesis Testing</h2>
We wish to test, assuming the SLRGN model, the following hypothesis:
\[ \begin{array}{ll} H_{0} : & \beta_{1} = \beta_{1}^{(0)} \\ H_{1} : & \beta_{1} \neq \beta_{1}^{(0)} \end{array}\]
at significance level \(\alpha\).

<ol>
	<li> <strong>Test Statistic Method:</strong>
	<ol>
	<li> Determine an appropriate test statistic for this hypothesis test.
	<li> Determine the rejection region for the appropriate test statistic for this hypothesis test at the significance level \(\alpha\).
	</ol>
	<li> <strong>Confidence Interval Method:</strong>
	<ol>
	<li> Determine the confidence interval that can be used to test this hypothesis.
	<li> Determine the condition for rejecting the null hypothesis using this confidence interval at the significance level \(\alpha\).
	</ol>
	<li> Show that the intervals of values of \(b_{1}\) for which the <strong>Test Statistic Method</strong> rejects the null hypothesis are equivalent to the intervals of values for which the <strong>Confidence Interval Method</strong> rejects the null hypothesis.
		<ul>
			<li> <strong>Hint:</strong> For each of the two methods, write the intervals of values for which the null hypothesis is rejected as inequalities involving \(\beta_{1}^{(0)}\) and \(b_{1}\). Then show that the inequalities for each method specify the same intervals of values for \(b_{1}\).
		</ul>
</ol>

<h2>Good Odds</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio">odds ratio</a> \(\rho\) is a quantity used in medical research to compare binary outcomes under two different treatments. An odds ratio of 1 indicates that there is no difference between the two treatments.
	
<p>A medical researcher has constructed a confidence curve to estimate the odds ratio between two treatments for some disease. The confidence curve from her sample data is given below.

<p><img src = "cc-problem.png" height="400" width="400"></img>

<ol>
	<li> What is the 80% confidence interval for the odds ratio?
	<li> What is the \(P\)-value associated with a two-sided hypothesis test of no difference between the two treatments?
</ol>

<h2>The Lazy Scientist</h2>

<p>A scientist tests the hypothesis
\[ \begin{array}{ll} H_{0} : & \beta_{1} = 0 \\ H_{1} : & \beta_{1} \neq 0 \end{array}\]
using a SLRGN-based \(P\)-value. He reports the following sample statistics
\[ \begin{aligned} n &= 101 \\ b_{1} &= 0.5 \\ s_{X} &= 2 \\ P &= 0.0013 \end{aligned}\]
Suppose you want to know the estimate of the variance of the noise in the SLRGN model, which the scientist was too lazy to report.

<ol>
	<li> What is the value of \(\widehat{\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}}\) implied by the reported statistics?
	<li> Can you still recover the estimate of the noise variance if he had tested
		\[ \begin{array}{ll} H_{0} : & \beta_{1} = 2 \\ H_{1} : & \beta_{1} \neq 2 \end{array}\]
		instead?
