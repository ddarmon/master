	<li>Problem 2.16ab
	<li>Problem 2.28ab
</ol>
<p><h3>Directions</h3>
<p>For problems that ask for a confidence / prediction interval at a specific predictor value, also plot a scatter plot of the data along with the pointwise confidence / prediction interval using functions from <tt>ggformula</tt>.

<p><h1>Chapter 5</h1>
<p> Complete the following 3 problems:
<ol>
	<li>Problem 5.1
		<ul>
			<li> Compute by-hand, and check your answers using R.
			<li> For matrix-matrix products, perform the computation using both the definition of a matrix-matrix product and the row-column rule.
		</ul>
	<li>Problem 5.2
		<ul>
			<li> Same directions as Problem 5.1
		</ul>
	<li>Problem 5.10
		<ul>
			<li> Use R to find the inverses and to verify that they are in fact inverses.
		</ul>
</ol>
<p><h3>Directions</h3>
<p>If you are not feeling up to the Herculean task of typesetting matrix arithmetic using LaTeX, you can write out your solutions (neatly!) by-hand.

<p><h1>Additional Problems</h1>
<p>Choose <strong>two</strong> problems from Homework 1-4 for which you lost points, and provide new solutions.

<p><strong>Important:</strong> You should not just parrot the solutions I have posted on eCampus. <strong>Think</strong> about the problems, without using the posted solutions.
