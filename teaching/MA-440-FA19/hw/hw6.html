<h1>Homework 5</h1>

<p><h1>Chapter 6</h1>
<p> Complete the following 6 problems:
<ol>
	<li>Problem 6.1
		<ul>
			<li>For this and the next problem, you can submit a hand-written solution if you do not want to figure out how to typeset matrices / vectors using LaTeX. 
		</ul>
	<li>Problem 6.2
	<li>Problem 6.5a-d
		<ul>
			<li>For part b, interpret both \(b_{1}\) and \(b_{2}\) <strong>in the context of the problem</strong>.
			<li>For part c, also plot a density plot with a rug plot.
			<li>For part d, also include the four-panel residual plot we used for simple linear regression.
		</ul>
	<li>Problem 6.10a-d
		<ul>
			<li>For part b, also plot a density plot with a rug plot.
			<li>For part c, also include the four-panel residual plot we used for simple linear regression.
			<li>For part d, a "time plot" is just a plot of residuals against the time index.
		</ul>
	<li>Problem 6.22
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Hint:</strong> Consider whether you can transform either the predictors or the response to put the equation in the form
			\[W_{i} = \beta_{0} + \sum_{j = 1}^{p} \beta_{j} Z_{i, j} + \epsilon_{i}\]
			where the \(W_{i} = g(Y_{i})\) and \(Z_{i, j} = h_{i}(X_{i, j})\).
		</ul>
	<li>Problem 6.25
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Hint:</strong>Can you create a transformed response variable that already accounts for the contribution of \(X_{i, 2}\) in the regression equation?
		</ul>
</ol>
