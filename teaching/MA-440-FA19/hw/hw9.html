This problem is extra credit. If you complete this problem <b>entirely correctly</b>, it will count as extra credit up to a (medium-sized) problem on Exam 2.

<h2>Equivalence of the Two-sample \(t\)-test and Regression with a Binary Indicator Variable</h2>

<p> Consider the setup for the two-sample \(t\)-test, where we have two independent random samples:
	\[ \begin{aligned} X_{1}, X_{2}, \ldots, X_{m} &\sim N(\mu_{1}, \sigma^{2}) \\ Y_{1}, Y_{2}, \ldots, Y_{n} &\sim N(\mu_{2}, \sigma^{2}) \end{aligned}\]
	<strong>Note:</strong> We are assuming <strong>equal variances</strong> but allowing <strong>unequal sample sizes</strong>.
	
	<p>As you learned in introductory statistics, the \(T\)-statistic for a hypothesis test about the difference between the means \(\mu_{1} - \mu_{2}\) is
	\[ T = \frac{\bar{X} - \bar{Y} - (\mu_{1} - \mu_{2})}{s_{\text{pooled}} \sqrt{1/m + 1/n}}\]
	where \(s_{\text{pooled}}^{2}\) is the pooled variance
	\[ s_{\text{pooled}}^{2} = \frac{\left(m-1\right) s_{X}^{2}+\left(n-1\right) s_{Y}^{2}}{m + n -2}.\]
	This \(T\)-statistic follows a \(t\)-distribution with \(m + n - 2\) degrees of freedom.
	
	<p>Consider an alternative way of encoding the data, where we set up the regression
	\[ W_{i} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} B_{i} + \epsilon_{i}, i = 1, 2, \ldots, m + n\]
	where \(B_{i}\) is a binary variable with
	\[ B_{i} = \begin{cases} 0 &: \text{Unit \(i\) is in the second sample} \\ 1 &: \text{Unit \(i\) is in the first sample} \end{cases}\]
	and we assume that \(\epsilon_{i} \stackrel{\text{iid}}{\sim} N(0, \sigma^{2})\). The \(T\)-statistic for \(\beta_{1}\) is
	\[ T = \frac{b_{1} - \beta_{1}}{s[b_{1}]},\]
	which will also be \(t\)-distributed with \(m + n - 2\) degrees of freedom under the SLRGN model assumptions.
	
	<p> In this problem, you will show that the \(T\)-statistic for the two-sample \(t\)-test is equivalent to the \(T\)-statistic for the regression.

		<li> Find the least squares estimates for \(\beta_{0}\) and \(\beta_{1}\) in the stated simple linear regression in terms of the sample statistics \(\bar{W}, \bar{B},\) and \(s_{B}^{2}\).
		<li>Determine how the least squares estimates for \(\beta_{0}\) and \(\beta_{1}\) in the stated simple linear regression are related to the sample statistics \(\bar{X}, \bar{Y}, s_{X}^{2}, s_{Y}^{2}, m, \) and \(n\).
			<p><strong>Hint:</strong> What are you <strong>expecting</strong> these estimates to be? That should give you a hint about the simplifications you can make.
		<li> Find the estimate of the standard error \(s[b_{1}]\) for the stated simple linear regression in terms of \(s_{B}^{2}, \widehat{\sigma_{\epsilon}^{2}}, m, \) and \(n\).
		<li>Determine how the estimate of the standard error \(s[b_{1}]\) for the stated simple linear regression is related to the sample statistics \(s_{\text{pooled}}^{2}, m, \) and \(n\).
		<p><strong>Hint:</strong> What are you <strong>expecting</strong> the denominator to be? That should give you a hint about the simplifications you can make.
		<li> Show that the \(T\)-statistic \(T = \frac{b_{1} - \beta_{1}}{s[b_{1}]}\) is equivalent to the \(T\)-statistic \(T = \frac{\bar{X} - \bar{Y} - (\mu_{1} - \mu_{2})}{s_{\text{pooled}} \sqrt{1/m + 1/n}}\), and conclude that both methods perform the same hypothesis test for the difference between the population means.
