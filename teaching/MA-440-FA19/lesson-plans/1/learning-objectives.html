<p><strong>Section 1.1: Relations Between Variables</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Explain the difference between a <strong>functional relationship</strong> and a <strong>statistical relationship</strong> between two variables.</li>
<li>State examples of functional relationships from the physical sciences, and posit statistical relationships from the social and biological sciences.</li>
<li>Interpret a scatter plot showing the association between two variables.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Section 1.2: Regression Models and Their Uses</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>State the two key components of a regression model.</li>
<li>Recognize the terminology <strong>predictor</strong> and <strong>response</strong>, and given a statistical relationship, identify which variable is the predictor and which variable is the response.</li>
<li>State the three main uses of a regression model.</li>
<li>Recognize that prediction of <span class="math">\(Y\)</span> using <span class="math">\(X\)</span> <strong>does not</strong> indicate that <span class="math">\(X\)</span> <strong>causes</strong> <span class="math">\(Y\)</span>.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Section 1.4: Data for Regression Analysis</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Distinguish between a population and a sample from that population.</li>
<li>Identify the two main sources of uncertainty associated with any inference from a sample to a population.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Lines of Best Fit (Portion of Section 1.3)</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>State the functional form a line of best fit.</li>
<li>Interpret the slope and intercept of a line of best fit in the context of a particular regression problem <strong>as they relate to prediction</strong>.</li>
</ol>
