<h1>Study Guide for Exam 1</h1>

<p>This will be a closed-book exam. You will be allowed to use R on a <strong>school</strong> computer for computations. This means you will not have access to, nor will you need to use, anything beyond Base R (e.g. <tt>mosaic</tt>, <tt>ggformula</tt>, <tt>confcurve</tt>, etc.) for the exam. You should, however, still <strong>know the commands from these packages</strong>, as you may be asked for the code to generate a provided figure, output from <tt>lm</tt>, etc.</p>

<p>You are permitted one 8.5 inch by 11 inch sheet of <strong>handwritten</strong> notes (<strong>one</strong> side) for this exam.</p>

<p>To do well on the exam, you should be able to do the following:</p>
