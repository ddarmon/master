<p><strong>Section 6.1: Multiple Regression Models</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>State the assumptions of the multiple linear regression (MLR) model as a system of equations when the distribution of the noise term is unspecified beyond its mean and variance-covariance.</li>
<li>State the assumptions of the multiple linear regression model as matrix-vector equation when the distribution of the noise term is unspecified beyond its mean and variance-covariance.</li>
<li>Sketch a drawing of the main parts of the multiple linear regression model with two predictors, including:

<ul>
<li>The population regression plane.</li>
<li>The expected value of the response.</li>
<li>The observed value of the response.</li>
<li>The error term.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>State the assumptions of the multiple linear regression with Gaussian noise (MLRGN) model.</li>

<ol>
<li>Explain the rationale for using the statistical properties of the residuals from a fitted multiple linear regression model as a proxy for the population errors.</li>
<li>State the relevant residual diagnostic plots to generate after fitting a multiple linear regression model.</li>
<li>Relate each residual diagnostic plot from the previous learning objective to the associated assumption of the multiple linear regression with Gaussian noise (MLRGN) model.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Define the multiple <span class="math">\(R^2\)</span> between a predictor variable and the other predictor variables in the model.</li>
<li>Reason about what makes the multiple <span class="math">\(R^2\)</span> between a predictor variable and the other predictor variables in the model large (<span class="math">\(\approx 1\)</span>) or small (<span class="math">\(\approx 0\)</span>).</li>
<li>State the sampling distribution of the coefficient estimators under the multiple linear regression with Gaussian noise (MLRGN) model.</li>
<li>State the sampling distribution of the studentized coefficient estimators under the multiple linear regression with Gaussian noise (MLRGN) model.</li>
