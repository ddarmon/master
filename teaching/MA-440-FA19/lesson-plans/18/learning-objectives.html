<p><strong>Section 7.3: Summary of Tests Concerning Regression Coefficients</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Explain why one might want to test if <strong>many regression coefficients at a time</strong> are equal to zero in the context of a larger model.</li>
<li>State the null and alternative hypotheses for a given claim about more than one regression coefficient in the context of a larger model.</li>
<li>State the test statistic used in a hypothesis test about more than one regression coefficient in the context of a larger model.</li>
<li>Explain, qualitatively, why an <span class="math">\(F\)</span>-statistic, as used in Multiple Linear Regression, will be large when the null hypothesis is false.</li>
<li>State the null and alternative hypotheses for an &#8220;overall <span class="math">\(F\)</span>-test&#8221; for a multiple linear regression.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Performing an <span class="math">\(F\)</span>-test in R (Lecture Notes for Lecture 17)</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Interpret the output of <code>anova</code> for an <span class="math">\(F\)</span>-test.</li>
<li>Perform an <span class="math">\(F\)</span>-test for a given claim about more than one regression coefficient in the context of a larger model using <code>anova</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Common Misinterpretations of <span class="math">\(F\)</span>-tests (Lecture Notes for Lecture 17)</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Give examples where non-significant overall <span class="math">\(F\)</span>-tests do not indicate that the predictors are not relevant to predicting the response.</li>
<li>Give examples where significant overall <span class="math">\(F\)</span>-tests do not indicate that the MLRGN model is correct.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Section 8.3: Qualitative Predictors</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Give examples of predictors that are appropriately modeled as categorical rather than quantitative variables.</li>
<li>Explain how to introduce a categorical predictor taking two categories into a multiple linear regression using an indicator (&#8220;dummy&#8221;) variable.</li>
<li>Interpret the coefficient on an indicator variable for a binary categorical predictor.</li>
<li>Interpret the intercept in a multiple linear regression with a single binary categorical predictor.</li>
<li>Describe, geometrically, what the coefficient on an indicator variable does to the multiple linear regression surface.</li>
<li>Explain how to introduce a categorical predictor taking more than two categories into a multiple linear regression using indicator variables.</li>
<li>Interpret the coefficients on indicator variables for a &gt;binary categorical predictor.</li>
<li>Interpret the intercept in a multiple linear regression with a single &gt;binary categorical predictor.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Fitting Regressions with Categorical Variables in R (Lecture Notes for Lecture 18)</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Describe the data type used by R for categorical variables.</li>
<li>Use <code>relevel</code> to set the baseline level of a factor.</li>
<li>Fit a multiple linear regression with a categorical predictor in R, and interpet the resulting coefficients <strong>in the context of the problem</strong>.</li>
<li>Given the design matrix for a multiple linear regression with a categorical predictor and knowledge of which category is treated as the baseline, identify the category of a given unit using the design matrix.</li>
<li>Explain how analysis of variance (ANOVA) and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) are related to multiple linear regression.</li>
