<p><strong>Section 8.1: Polynomial Regression Models</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Define a polynomial regression.</li>
<li>Construct a design matrix for a given polynomial regression.</li>
<li>Explain why it is not, generally, a good idea to fit a very high degree polynomial to predict a response variable from a predictor variable.</li>
<li>Fit a polynomial regression in R using <code>poly</code>.</li>
<li>Fit a polynomial regression in R using <code>poly</code> with the argument <code>raw = TRUE</code>, and explain how this differs from using <code>poly</code> with the argument <code>raw = FALSE</code>.</li>
<li>Explain why it may make sense to use a polynomial regression even when you do not believe the expected relationship between the predictor and the response is polynomial.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Section 8.2: Interaction Regression Models</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>State the definition of non-interaction between two or more variables in terms of an appropriate partial derivative.</li>
<li>Construct a design matrix that would incorporate a simple product interaction into a multiple linear regression model.</li>
<li>Interpret the coefficient on a product term of two quantitative predictors in a multiple linear regression.</li>
<li>Explain why the &#8220;expected change in the response for a unit change in the predictor, holding all other predictors constant&#8221; interpretation of a coefficient no longer makes sense when an interaction term is included in a multiple linear regression.</li>
<li>Fit a multiple linear regression model with interaction terms in R using <code>:</code> and <code>*</code>.</li>
<li>Interpret the output of <code>lm</code> when used to fit a multiple linear regression model with an interaction term.</li>
<li>Give examples of models with interactions where an estimated multiple linear regression (without the interaction term) and its coefficient estimates would be highly significant, but the model is clearly wrong.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Section 8.5: Modeling Interactions Between Quantitative and Qualitative Predictors</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Construct a multiple linear regression model with an interaction between two categorical predictors.</li>
<li>Interpret the coefficients in a multiple linear regression model with an interaction between two categorical predictors.</li>
<li>Construct a multiple linear regression model with an interaction between a categorical predictor and a quantitative predictor.</li>
<li>Interpret the coefficients in a multiple linear regression model with an interaction between a categorical predictor and a quantitative predictor.</li>
<li>Explain, geometrically, what an interaction between a categorical predictor and a quantitative predictor incorporates into a multiple linear regression model.</li>
