<p><strong>Duality Between Confidence Intervals and Hypothesis Testing (Lecture Notes for Lecture 7)</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Use a two-sided confidence level <span class="math">\(c\)</span> confidence interval to perform a two-sided significance level <span class="math">\(\alpha\)</span> hypothesis test.</li>
<li>Explain, loosely, why we reject a point (two-sided) null hypothesis when the null value of the parameter does not fall in a confidence interval.</li>
<li>Compare and contrast accept/reject hypothesis testing with confidence intervals in terms of their strengths and weaknesses.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Practical versus Statistical Significance (Lecture Notes for Lecture 7)</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Explain the difference between statistical and practical significance.</li>
<li>Give the origin of the phrase &#8220;statistical significance.&#8221;</li>
<li>Explain why a <span class="math">\(P\)</span>-value, on its own, indicates nothing about practical significance.</li>
<li>Explain how a confidence interval can be used to identify both statistical and practical significance.</li>
<li>Construct a hypothetical scenario where a result may be:

<ul>
<li>statistically significant but not practically significant.</li>
<li>practically significant but not statistically significant.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Confidence Curves (Lecture Notes for Lecture 7)</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Give a constructive definition of a confidence curve in terms of two-sided confidence intervals for a population parameter.</li>
<li>State how to construct the confidence curve for the mean of a Gaussian population.</li>
<li>State how to construct the confidence curves for the population slope and intercept under the SLRGN model.</li>
<li>Given a confidence curve for a population parameter and a ruler, identify:

<ul>
<li>a point estimate for a population parameter</li>
<li>a confidence level <span class="math">\(c\)</span> confidence interval for the population parameter</li>
<li>a <span class="math">\(P\)</span>-value for the two-sided hypothesis test for the point null hypothesis <span class="math">\(\theta = \theta_{0}\)</span>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Interpret a confidence curve in terms of what it indicates about our certainty about the value of a population parameter.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong><tt>confcurve</tt> in R (Lecture Notes for Lecture 7)</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Use <tt>confcurve</tt> to plot SLRGN confidence curves for the population slope and intercept using an output from <tt>lm</tt>.</li>
<li>Use <tt>confcurve</tt> to compute SLRGN two-sided <span class="math">\(P\)</span>-values for the population slope and intercept using an output from <tt>lm</tt>.</li>
