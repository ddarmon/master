<h1>CS 201-A01, Introduction to Computer Programming for Data Science</h1>

<h2>Spring 2021</h2>

<center>
Monday, 2:50 PM &mdash; 4:10 PM, Howard Hall 307
</center>

<P>The methods of data science can broadly be broken into two distinct tasks: <em>algorithms</em> for fitting models to data and <em>inferences</em> to be made from those models. This class is a first course on the <em>algorithmic</em> side of data science. You will learn the core concepts of programming &mdash; functions, objects, data structures, flow control, debugging, logical design, and abstraction &mdash; by writing code to implement data science algorithms. Programming and programming languages are inherently social, so you will also learn the customs and conventions of the tribe of programmers who use R as well as best-practices for organizing and commenting your code.

<h2>Course Mechanics</h2>

<h4>Office Hours</h4>

<p>I will have office hours at the following four times each week:

<center><table>
    <tr><td>Monday, &nbsp;&nbsp;01:30&mdash;2:30 PM</td> <td>Howard Hall 241</td></tr>
</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Tuesday, &nbsp;&nbsp;03:00&mdash;04:00 PM</td> <td>Howard Hall 241</td></tr>
</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Thursday, 10:00&mdash;11:00 AM</td> <td>Howard Hall 241</td></tr>
</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Thursday, 01:30&mdash;02:30 PM</td> <td>Howard Hall 241</td></tr>
</table></center>

<p>Or graphically:

<center><img src = "spring21.png" style="width:625.5;height:511.75px;"></img></center>

<p>I will be available for office hours both in-person and on Zoom. For in-person office hours, please email me to make an appointment during one of the times above.

<p>If you are struggling with the homework, having difficulty with the quizzes, or just want to chat, please visit me during my office hours. I am here to help.

<h4>Grading Policy</h4> 

Your final grade will be determined by the following weighting scheme:

<dl>
	<dd> 50% for homework problem sets
	<dd> 20% for labs
	<dd> 25% for quizzes
	<dd> 5% for class participation
</dl>

I will use the standard 10-point breakdown to assign letter grades to numerical grades:
<ul>
	<li> \([90, 100] \to \text{A}\)
	<li> \([80, 90) \,\,\, \to \text{B}\)
	<li> \([70, 80) \,\,\, \to \text{C}\)
	<li> \([60, 70) \,\,\, \to \text{D}\)
	<li> \([0, 60) \,\,\,\,\,\, \to \text{F}\)
</ul>
with pluses and minuses assigned by dividing the intervals into thirds.

<h4>Homework</h4>

<p>Homework will be assigned regularly, announced in class, and listed in the <a href="#schedule">Schedule</a> section of this page.

<p>Each homework problem will be graded out of three points: one point for making an honest effort to complete the problem, one point for a technically-correct solution, and one point for clean, well-formatted, documented, and easily readable code.

<p>You will have the opportunity to revise your homework within a week after it is returned and resubmit the new solution to earn back partial credit.

<h4>Labs</h4>

<p>There will be two labs during the semester. The labs will involve brief exercises related to the latest homework assignment. Attending labs is mandatory. If you miss a lab, your grade for that lab will be a 0.

<p><em>Pair programming:</em> Labs will be completed in groups using "pair programming," a software development technique where programmers alternate between two roles: a <em>driver</em> who writes the code and an <em>observer</em> who reviews each line of code for correctness and strategizes ways to improve the code moving forward. For each lab, you will randomly be assigned to a partner and the role of either driver or observer. Halfway through the lab, you will switch roles with your partner.
	
<h4>Quizzes</h4>

There will be a 20-minute quiz at the beginning of each lab session. Each quiz will contain problems related to the material covered in the readings and during the lectures for a given unit of material. If you miss a quiz, your grade will be a zero for that quiz.

<h4>Class Participation</h4>

I expect you to be fully engaged during each class, to ask questions when confused, and to attempt to answer questions when called on. During class, attempting to answer a question is more important than getting the correct answer.

<h4>Attendance</h4>

Required. If you expect to miss 2-3 sessions of the course, you should take the course during another semester.

<h4>Textbook</h4>

<P>The <strong>required</strong> textbook is:
<ul>
<li>W. John Braun and Duncan J. Murdoch. <em>A First Course in Statistical Programming with R</em>, 2nd Edition (Cambridge University Press, 2016).
</ul>

<h4>Collaboration, Cheating, and Plagiarism</h4>

All submitted work should be your own. You are welcome and encouraged to use the Internet and consult with others while working on an assignment.  However, whenever you have had assistance with a problem, you must state so at the beginning of the problem solution.  Unless this mechanism is abused, there will be no reduction in credit for using and reporting such assistance. This policy applies to both individual and group work. In group work, you only need to acknowledge help from outside the group.

<h4>Statement on Special Accommodations</h4>

Students with disabilities who need special accommodations for this class are encouraged to meet with me or the appropriate disability service provider on campus as soon as possible.  In order to receive accommodations, students must be registered with the appropriate disability service provider on campus as set forth in the student handbook and must follow the University procedure for self-disclosure, which is stated in the University <em>Guide to Services and Accommodations for Students with Disabilities</em>.  Students will not be afforded any special accommodations for academic work completed prior to the disclosure of the disability, nor will they be afforded any special accommodations prior to the completion of the documentation process with the appropriate disability office.

<h4>School of Science Commitment to Equity and Inclusion</h4>

The School of Science does not discriminate based on race, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or religion. We strive to create a learning environment that allows everyone to succeed and grow. Towards that end, we are here to assist you in any way we can. Should you experience any difficulties or challenges due to discriminatory or harassing behaviors of any sort in your classes, please know that many people are available to help. You can contact your professor, your academic advisor, the department chair, or any of the Deans (Dean Bachrach, Associate Dean Duckett and Assistant Dean Tiedemann) by email or phone or to meet in person by appointment.  There are also resources available in the larger University community including the Office of Equity and Diversity and the Intercultural Center.

<h4>COVID-19 and In-person Meetings</h4>
 
<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is critically important that we care for ourselves and each other by taking strict measures to avoid spreading SARS-CoV-2. It is therefore a requirement that face masks are worn properly and appropriate physical distancing is maintained at all times during all classes. 

<p>When entering a room, please pick up disinfectant wipes and move as far into the classroom as possible in order to help maintain physical distances. Similarly, leave the room in an orderly fashion and dispose of the wipes on the way out.

<p>Students should wipe down their desktops upon arrival.

<p>Students are expected to wipe down keyboards and monitors with disinfectant wipes (provided) both before and after use.

<p>For further information about COVID-19-related policies, please refer to the Student Handbook.

<h4>FERPA Video Prohibition</h4>

Under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), your education records as a student are confidential and protected. Under most circumstances your records will not be released without your written and signed consent. Part of a student's protected and confidential education records include video and / or audio recordings of students within the classroom. As such, students are <b>strictly prohibited</b> from video or audio recording distance learning lectures off of any platform utilized by professors (Zoom, Webex, etc.). A prohibited recording includes, but is not limited to recordings using the platform, a cell phone, tablet, video camera, audio capture device, etc. Students may be subject to disciplinary action under the Student Code of Conduct if found to have made any video and/or audio recording distance learning lectures without proper consent.

<div id="R"><h2>R</h2></div>

<P>We will use R, a programming language for statistical computing, throughout the semester for in-class activities and homework assignments. I will cover the relevant features of R throughout the course.
	
<p>You should install R on your personal computer. You can install R by following the instructions <a href="https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/base/">for Windows here</a>, <a href="https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/macosx/">for macOS here</a>, or <a href="https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/linux/">for Linux here</a>.
