<h1>MA 115, Pre-Calculus Modeling for the Biological Sciences, Section 04</h1>

<h2>Fall 2018</h2>


<center>
Section 04: Tuesday and Friday, 11:40 AM — 1:00 PM, Howard Hall 309
</center>

<P>Here's the official description:
<blockquote>Provides a development of an understanding of linear, exponential, logarithmic, polynomial and trigonometric functions related to biological phenomena. The development is from an algebraic, graphical and modelling perspective. In addition, the solutions of equations and inequalities related to these functions are studied. Use of related technology is included.</blockquote>

<P>This course covers the prerequisites necessary to develop and use mathematical models as they appear in the biological sciences. It is centered around the concept of a function: a way to map from one set of things to another. We will develop the language of functions, which requires knowledge of its vocabulary and grammar. We begin with a refresher on algebra, including variables, arithmetic with variables, expressions, equations and inequalities, and functions and their graphs. We then cover the elementary functions: polynomial, exponential, logarithmic, and trigonometric. We will consider these functions in context, both historical and scientific, emphasizing why they were invented in the first place and where you are likely to find them in biological models. We finish the class with a taste of more advanced topics, including systems of linear equations and sequences and summations.

<h4>Prerequisites</h4>

<P>MA 101 passed with a grade of C- or higher or Math Placement Level 3 or 4.

<h2>Topics, Notes, Readings</h2>

<P>This is currently a <em>tentative</em> listing of topics, in order.


<dl>
	<dt><em>Review of algebra:</em> Integer exponents as shorthand for repeated multiplication or division. Radicals. Rational exponents as another notation for radicals. What does it mean for two expressions to be equal? Inequalities. The coordinate plane. Plotting graphs of equations in the coordinate plane.
	<dt><em>Polynomial functions:</em> Three viewpoints of a function: tables, graphs, equations. Linear polynomials. Quadratic polynomials. General polynomials.
	<dt><em>Exponential and logarithmic functions:</em> Exponentiation as repeated multiplication. The exponential function. Contrasting the exponential function with a monomial function. The natural exponent. The logarithm as the inverse of the exponential function. Rules for manipulating expressions involving logarithms.
	<dt><em>Trigonometric functions:</em> The unit circle. Sine, cosine, and tangent. Harmonic motion. Periodic behavior.
	<dt><em>Systems of linear equations:</em> Moving from equality in a single equation to equality in a group (system) of equations. Systems of two linear equations. Types of solutions for systems of two linear equations. Solving systems of linear equations by substituting, eliminating, or graphing. Systems of more than two linear equations.
	<dt><em>Sequences and summation:</em> Sequences as functions of counting numbers. Recursive sequences. Difference equations. "Sigma" notation as shorthand for summing a sequence. Arithmetic sequences. Geometric sequences.

<h4>Grading Policy</h4> 

Your final grade will be determined by:

<dl>
	<dd> 50% for 4 in-class exams (12.5% each)
	<dd> 20% for a cumulative final exam
	<dd> 15% for in-class quizzes
	<dd> 15% for homework problem sets
</dl>

<h4>Quizzes</h4>

Quizzes will be given during the first 10 minutes of a Tuesday class session. Quizzes will not be every week: I will announce quizzes at least one class session before they will occur. If you miss a quiz your grade will be zero for that quiz. Your lowest two quiz grades of the semester will be dropped.

<h4>Homework</h4>

Homework will be assigned at the end of every class meeting, and listed in the <a href="#schedule">Schedule</a> section of this page. Homework assignments are due at the beginning of the next class meeting. You should attempt all assigned homework problems. Only turn in problems labeled <strong>To Hand In</strong>.

<p>Some of the homework assignments will be through <a href="http://webassign.net/">WebAssign</a>. See this <a href="http://www.webassign.net/manual/WA_Student_Quick_Start.pdf">Quick Start Guide</a> provided by WebAssign for details on setting up your account. The class key for this course is below.

<p><b>Class Key:</b> <tt>MONMOUTH 4970 6449</tt>

<h4>Attendance</h4>

Required. If you expect to miss 2-3 sessions of the course, you should take the course during another semester.

<h4>Examination Absences</h4>

If you miss an examination your grade will be zero for that exam.  If you know you will be absent for an exam you must let me know at least one week in advance to schedule a make-up exam.

<h4>Textbook</h4>

<P>The <strong>required</strong> textbook is:
<ul>
<li> James Stewart, Lothar Redlin, and Saleem Watson, <em>Precalculus: Mathematics for Calculus</em>, 7th edition (Cengage Learning, 2015, ISBN: 9781305701618). <a href = "http://mubookstore.monmouth.edu/TextBookDetail.aspx?BookPriceID=7118794&MBSNumber=1765975&SecID=9609222&trm=FALL%2018#.W3Q3eJMzphE">Link to University Store</a>
</ul>




<h4>Collaboration, Cheating, and Plagiarism</h4>

All submitted work should be your own. You are welcome and encouraged to consult with others while working on an assignment, including other students in the class and tutors in the <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/department-mathematics/math-learning-center/">Mathematics Learning Center</a>.  However, whenever you have had assistance with a problem, you must state so at the beginning of the problem solution.  Unless this mechanism is abused, there will be no reduction in credit for using and reporting such assistance.  This policy applies to both individual and group work. In group work, you only need to acknowledge help from outside the group. This policy does <b>not</b> apply to examinations.

<h4>Statement on Special Accommodations</h4>

Students with disabilities who need special accommodations for this class are encouraged to meet with me or the appropriate disability service provider on campus as soon as possible.  In order to receive accommodations, students must be registered with the appropriate disability service provider on campus as set forth in the student handbook and must follow the University procedure for self-disclosure, which is stated in the University <em>Guide to Services and Accommodations for Students with Disabilities</em>.  Students will not be afforded any special accommodations for academic work completed prior to the disclosure of the disability, nor will they be afforded any special accommodations prior to the completion of the documentation process with the appropriate disability office.
