<h1>MA-115, Pre-Calculus Modeling for the Biological Sciences, Section 04</h1>

<h2>Fall 2018</h2>


<center>
Section 01: Tuesday and Friday, 11:40 AM — 1:00 PM, Howard Hall 309
</center>

<P>Here's the official description:
<blockquote>Provides a development of an understanding of linear, exponential, logarithmic, polynomial and trigonometric functions related to biological phenomena. The development is from an algebraic, graphical and modelling perspective. In addition, the solutions of equations and inequalities related to these functions are studied. Use of related technology is included.</blockquote>
