<h1>MA 151-02, Statistics with Applications</h1>

<h2>Fall 2019</h2>

Section 02: Tuesday, 1:15 PM &ndash; 2:35 PM; Thursday, 11:40 AM &ndash; 1:00 PM, Howard Hall 308
</center>

<P>Here's the official description:
<blockquote>Analysis of data, probability, random variables, normal distribution, sampling theory, confidence intervals, and statistical inference.</blockquote>

<P>This course covers the process of statistical analysis from beginning to end. That process, in broad strokes, is as follows: we pose a scientific question, determine what experiments or observations might provide data towards answering that question, develop approaches to collecting that data, summarize the resulting data, and derive inferences relevant to the original scientific question. In the process, you will learn about sampling, descriptive statistics, probability, probability models, inferential statistics, confidence intervals, hypothesis tests, and regression. You will also learn how to analyze data using R, a programming language ideally suited for statistical computing.

<h4>Prerequisites</h4>

<P>MA 101 or MA 105 passed with a grade of C- or higher, or Math Placement Level 3 or 4. Not open to computer science majors or to students required to complete MA 125, except software engineering majors.

</dl>

<p> <strong>Note:</strong> These are the <strong>only</strong> opportunities for extra credit in this course.

<h4>Homework</h4>

Homework will be assigned at the end of every class meeting, and listed on the Sapling page for this course. Homework assignments are due at the beginning of the next class meeting.

<h4>Attendance</h4>

Required. If you expect to miss 2-3 sessions of the course, you should take the course during another semester.

<h4>Examination Absences</h4>

If you miss an examination your grade will be zero for that exam.  If you know you will be absent for an exam you must let me know at least one week in advance to schedule a make-up exam.

<h4>Textbook</h4>

<P>The <strong>required</strong> textbook is:
<ul>
<li> Brigitte Baldi and David S. Moore, <em>The Practice of Statistics in the Life Sciences</em>, 4th Edition (W. H. Freeman and Company, 2018, ISBN: 9781319013370).
</ul>

<h4>Collaboration, Cheating, and Plagiarism</h4>

All submitted work should be your own. You are welcome and encouraged to consult with others while working on an assignment, including other students in the class and tutors in the <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/department-mathematics/math-learning-center/">Mathematics Learning Center</a>.  However, whenever you have had assistance with a problem, you must state so at the beginning of the problem solution.  Unless this mechanism is abused, there will be no reduction in credit for using and reporting such assistance.  This policy applies to both individual and group work. In group work, you only need to acknowledge help from outside the group. This policy does <b>not</b> apply to examinations.

<h4>Statement on Special Accommodations</h4>

Students with disabilities who need special accommodations for this class are encouraged to meet with me or the appropriate disability service provider on campus as soon as possible.  In order to receive accommodations, students must be registered with the appropriate disability service provider on campus as set forth in the student handbook and must follow the University procedure for self-disclosure, which is stated in the University <em>Guide to Services and Accommodations for Students with Disabilities</em>.  Students will not be afforded any special accommodations for academic work completed prior to the disclosure of the disability, nor will they be afforded any special accommodations prior to the completion of the documentation process with the appropriate disability office.

<div id="R"><h2>R</h2></div>

<P>We will use R, a programming language for statistical computing, throughout the semester for in-class activities and homework assignments. I will cover the relevant features of R throughout the course.

<p>You can access R from any web accessible computer using <a href = "https://rstudio.cloud">RStudio Cloud</a>. You will need to create an account on RStudio Cloud from their <a href = "https://login.rstudio.cloud/register">Registration page</a>. I will send out a link via email for you to join a Space on RStudio Cloud for this course. Resources for homeworks, labs, etc., will be hosted on RStudio Cloud for easy access.
	
<p>You can also install R on your personal computer, if you have one. You can install R by following the instructions <a href="https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/base/">for Windows here</a>, <a href="https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/macosx/">for macOS here</a>, or <a href="https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/linux/">for Linux here</a>. You will also want to install RStudio, and Integrated Development Environment for R, which you can find <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download">here</a>.

<p>We will use R as a scripting language and statistical calculator, and thus will not get into the nitty-gritty of programming in R. We will largely use functionality built into the <tt>mosaic</tt> library in R. You can find a comprehensive tutorial to using R and <tt>mosaic</tt> <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Horton+Pruim+Kaplan_MOSAIC-StudentGuide.pdf">here</a>.
	
<div id="anki"><h2>Anki</h2></div>

<P> As stated in the <strong>Extra Credit</strong> section, you will have the opportunity to use <a href = "https://ankiweb.net/about">Anki</a> for spaced retrieval practice throughout the semester. Anki is open-source, free (as in both <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre"><em>gratis</em> and <em>libre</em></a>) software. You can download Anki to your personal computer from <a href = "https://apps.ankiweb.net/#download">this link</a>. If you have ever used flashcards, then Anki should be fairly intuitive. If you would like more details you can find Anki's User Manual <a href = "https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html">here</a>.
