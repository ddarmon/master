<title>MA 151-04 Statistics with Applications (Fall 2018)</title>

<a href="http://www.thirdorderscientist.org"><em>David Darmon</em></a>

<h1>MA 151-04, Statistics with Applications</h1>

<h2>Fall 2018</h2>


<center>
Section 04: Wednesday and Friday, 10:05 AM — 11:25 AM, Howard Hall 308
</center>

<P>Here's the official description:
<blockquote>Analysis of data, probability, random variables, normal distribution, sampling theory, confidence intervals, and statistical inference.</blockquote>

<P>This course covers the process of statistical analysis from beginning to end. That process, in broad strokes, is as follows: we pose a scientific question, determine what experiments or observations might provide data towards answering that question, develop approaches to collecting that data, summarize the resulting data, and derive inferences relevant to the original scientific question. In the process, we will learn about sampling, descriptive statistics, probability, probability models, inferential statistics, confidence intervals, hypothesis tests, and regression. A special emphasis will be given to common pitfalls in statistical analysis you are likely to see 'in the wild', including mis-interpretations / mis-understandings of statistical procedures, the conflation of association and causation, and the reproducibility crisis in psychology, medicine, and nutrition. 

<h4>Prerequisites</h4>

<P>MA 101 or MA 105 passed with a grade of C- or higher, or Math Placement Level 3 or 4. Not open to computer science majors or to students required to complete MA 125, except software engineering majors.

<h2>Topics, Notes, Readings</h2>

<P>This is currently a <em>tentative</em> listing of topics, in order.


<dl>
	<dt><em>Introduction:</em> What is statistics? Where do data come from? Experimental versus observational studies. Types of data.
    <dt><em>Descriptive statistics as summaries of data:</em> Summaries of the entire data distribution: rug plot, dot plot, histogram, box plot. Measures of center: mean, median, mode. Measures of variation: range, standard deviation, mean absolute deviation.
    <dt><em>Probability:</em> The origin of probability in games of chance. The interpretation of probability. Computing probabilities involving two or more events using the addition and multiplication rules. Conditional probability and independence.
    <dt><em>Discrete random variables:</em> Random variables as 'numbers that could have been otherwise.' Probability mass functions. The binomial distribution and its properties.
    <dt><em>Continuous random variables:</em> Summarizing quantitative data with histograms. From histograms to probability density functions. The normal distribution and its properties. Using the normal distribution to approximate the binomial distribution.
    <dt><em>Hypothesis tests:</em> Hypothesis tests for population means and proportions. Components of a hypothesis test. Types of error in hypothesis testing. Scientific hypotheses and statistical hypotheses. Statistical significance and practical significance. <em>P</em>-values.
    <dt><em>Confidence intervals:</em> Confidence intervals for population means and proportions. Confidence intervals as interval estimators. The interpretation of confidence intervals. Using confidence intervals for hypothesis tests. Using confidence intervals to distinguish between practical and statistical significance.
    <dt><em>Everything but the kitchen sink:</em> Two-sample tests for population means and their associated confidence intervals. Two-sample tests for population proportions and their associated confidence intervals. Tests for independence and homogeneity using contingency tables. Two-sample tests for equality of population variances. 
    <dt><em>Correlation and Regression:</em> Exploratory data analysis for two or more quantitative variables. Pearson's correlation coefficient. Hypothesis test for zero correlation between two quantitative variables. Association does not imply causation. Simple linear regression. Interpretation of regression coefficients.

<h4>Grading Policy</h4> 

Your final grade will be determined by:

<dl>
	<dd> 60% for 3 in-class exams (20% each)
	<dd> 25% for a cumulative final exam
	<dd> 12% for homework problem sets
	<dd> &nbsp;&nbsp;3%  for class participation
</dl>

<h4>Homework</h4>

Homework will be assigned at the end of every class meeting, and listed in the <a href="#schedule">Schedule</a> section of this page. Homework assignments are due at the beginning of the next class meeting.

<h4>Attendance</h4>

Required. If you expect to miss 2-3 sessions of the course, you should take the course during another semester.

<h4>Examination Absences</h4>

If you miss an examination your grade will be zero for that exam.  If you know you will be absent for an exam you must let me know at least one week in advance to schedule a make-up exam.

<h4>Textbook</h4>

<P>The <strong>required</strong> textbook is:
<ul>
<li> Marc M. Triola and Mario F. Triola, <em>Biostatistics for the Biological and Health Sciences</em>, 1st Edition (Pearson, 2005, ISBN: 9780321194367). <a href = "http://mubookstore.monmouth.edu/TextBookDetail.aspx?BookPriceID=2292892&MBSNumber=735071&SecID=9609248&trm=FALL%2018#.W3RgEZMzphE">Link to University Store</a>
</ul>

<h4>Collaboration, Cheating, and Plagiarism</h4>

All submitted work should be your own. You are welcome and encouraged to consult with others while working on an assignment, including other students in the class and tutors in the <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/department-mathematics/math-learning-center/">Mathematics Learning Center</a>.  However, whenever you have had assistance with a problem, you must state so at the beginning of the problem solution.  Unless this mechanism is abused, there will be no reduction in credit for using and reporting such assistance.  This policy applies to both individual and group work. In group work, you only need to acknowledge help from outside the group. This policy does <b>not</b> apply to examinations.

<h4>Statement on Special Accommodations</h4>

Students with disabilities who need special accommodations for this class are encouraged to meet with me or the appropriate disability service provider on campus as soon as possible.  In order to receive accommodations, students must be registered with the appropriate disability service provider on campus as set forth in the student handbook and must follow the University procedure for self-disclosure, which is stated in the University <em>Guide to Services and Accommodations for Students with Disabilities</em>.  Students will not be afforded any special accommodations for academic work completed prior to the disclosure of the disability, nor will they be afforded any special accommodations prior to the completion of the documentation process with the appropriate disability office.

<h2>Minitab</h2>

<P>We will be using <a href="http://www.minitab.com/en-US/default.aspx">Minitab</a> throughout the semester for in-class activities and homework assignments. You can access Minitab from any on-campus computer. I will cover the relevant features of Minitab throughout the course. You can find a guide for getting started with Minitab <a href="https://www.minitab.com/uploadedFiles/Documents/getting-started/MinitabGettingStarted_EN.pdf">here</a>.
