<P>This course covers the process of statistical analysis from beginning to end. That process, in broad strokes, is as follows: we pose a scientific question, determine what experiments or observations might provide data towards answering that question, develop approaches to collecting that data, summarize the resulting data, and derive inferences relevant to the original scientific question. In the process, we will learn about sampling, descriptive statistics, probability, probability models, inferential statistics, confidence intervals, hypothesis tests, and regression. A special emphasis will be given to common pitfalls in statistical analysis you are likely to see 'in the wild', including mis-interpretations / mis-understandings of statistical procedures, the conflation of association and causation, and the reproducibility crisis in psychology, medicine, and nutrition. 

<h4>Prerequisites</h4>

<h2>Course Mechanics</h2>

<h4>Office Hours</h4>

<p>I will have office hours at the following four times each week:

<center><table>
    <tr><td>Monday, &nbsp;&nbsp;01:30&mdash;2:30 PM</td> <td>Howard Hall 241</td></tr>
</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Tuesday, &nbsp;&nbsp;03:00&mdash;04:00 PM</td> <td>Howard Hall 241</td></tr>
</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Thursday, 10:00&mdash;11:00 AM</td> <td>Howard Hall 241</td></tr>
</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Thursday, 01:30&mdash;02:30 PM</td> <td>Howard Hall 241</td></tr>
</table></center>

<p>Or graphically:

<center><img src = "spring21.png" style="width:625.5;height:511.75px;"></img></center>

<p>I will be available for office hours both in-person and on Zoom. For in-person office hours, please email me to make an appointment during one of the times above.

<p>If you are struggling with the homework, having difficulty with the quizzes, or just want to chat, please visit me during my office hours. I am here to help.

<h4>Grading Policy</h4> 

Your final grade will be determined by the following weighting scheme:

<dl>
	<dd> 45% for 2 in-class exams (22.5% each)
	<dd> 25% for a cumulative final exam
	<dd> 15% for homework problem sets
	<dd> 10% for quizzes
	<dd> 5% for class participation
</dl>

I will use the standard 10-point breakdown to assign letter grades to numerical grades:
<ul>
	<li> \([90, 100] \to \text{A}\)
	<li> \([80, 90) \,\,\, \to \text{B}\)
	<li> \([70, 80) \,\,\, \to \text{C}\)
	<li> \([60, 70) \,\,\, \to \text{D}\)
	<li> \([0, 60) \,\,\,\,\,\, \to \text{F}\)
</ul>
with pluses and minuses assigned by dividing the intervals into thirds.

<h4>Homework</h4>

Homework will be assigned at the end of every class meeting, and listed in the <a href="#schedule">Schedule</a> section of this page. Homework assignments are due at the beginning of the next class meeting.

<h4>Quizzes</h4>

<p> Quizzes will be given during the first 10 minutes of some class sessions. Quizzes may not be every week: I will announce quizzes at least one class session before they will occur. If you miss a quiz your grade will be zero for that quiz. Your lowest two quiz grades of the semester will be dropped.

<h4>Class Participation</h4>

I expect you to be fully engaged during each class, to ask questions when confused, and to attempt to answer questions when called on. Attempting to answer a question is more important than getting the correct answer.

<h4>Attendance</h4>

Required. If you expect to miss 2-3 sessions of the course, you should take the course during another semester.

<h4>Zoom</h4>

We will use Zoom for our remote meetings. During a remote meeting, try to make your surroundings conducive to learning: find a quiet place, close applications and windows on your computer unrelated to class, and clear your work area of other possible distractions. You are expected to have your camera on during the lecture. You are also expected to have the ability to talk during lecture. Under extenuating circumstances where you are unable to talk, you may interact with the class via the Chat feature in Zoom.

<p>In the event that a quiz or test must be taken remotely, I will provide guidelines for how we will hold the quiz or test over Zoom.

<h4>Examination Absences</h4>

If you miss an examination your grade will be zero for that exam.  If you know you will be absent for an exam you must let me know at least one week in advance to schedule a make-up exam.

<h4>Textbook</h4>

<P>The <strong>required</strong> textbook is:
<ul>
<li>Jay L. Devore and Kenneth N. Berk. <em>Modern mathematical statistics with applications</em>, 1st Edition (Cengage Learning, 2007). <a href = "http://mubookstore.monmouth.edu/TextBookDetail.aspx?BookPriceID=2292893&MBSNumber=747336&SecID=9614832&trm=SPRING%2019#.XBl34y2ZNhE">Link to University Store</a>
</ul>

<h4>Collaboration, Cheating, and Plagiarism</h4>

All submitted work should be your own. You are welcome and encouraged to consult with others while working on an assignment, including other students in the class and tutors in the <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/department-mathematics/math-learning-center/">Mathematics Learning Center</a>.  However, whenever you have had assistance with a problem, you must state so at the beginning of the problem solution.  Unless this mechanism is abused, there will be no reduction in credit for using and reporting such assistance.  This policy applies to both individual and group work. In group work, you only need to acknowledge help from outside the group. This policy does <b>not</b> apply to examinations.

<h4>Statement on Special Accommodations</h4>

Students with disabilities who need special accommodations for this class are encouraged to meet with me or the appropriate disability service provider on campus as soon as possible.  In order to receive accommodations, students must be registered with the appropriate disability service provider on campus as set forth in the student handbook and must follow the University procedure for self-disclosure, which is stated in the University <em>Guide to Services and Accommodations for Students with Disabilities</em>.  Students will not be afforded any special accommodations for academic work completed prior to the disclosure of the disability, nor will they be afforded any special accommodations prior to the completion of the documentation process with the appropriate disability office.

<h4>School of Science Commitment to Equity and Inclusion</h4>

The School of Science does not discriminate based on race, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or religion. We strive to create a learning environment that allows everyone to succeed and grow. Towards that end, we are here to assist you in any way we can. Should you experience any difficulties or challenges due to discriminatory or harassing behaviors of any sort in your classes, please know that many people are available to help. You can contact your professor, your academic advisor, the department chair, or any of the Deans (Dean Bachrach, Associate Dean Duckett and Assistant Dean Tiedemann) by email or phone or to meet in person by appointment.  There are also resources available in the larger University community including the Office of Equity and Diversity and the Intercultural Center.

<h4>COVID-19 and In-person Meetings</h4>
 
<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is critically important that we care for ourselves and each other by taking strict measures to avoid spreading SARS-CoV-2. It is therefore a requirement that face masks are worn properly and appropriate physical distancing is maintained at all times during all classes. 

<p>When entering a room, please pick up disinfectant wipes and move as far into the classroom as possible in order to help maintain physical distances. Similarly, leave the room in an orderly fashion and dispose of the wipes on the way out.

<p>Students should wipe down their desktops upon arrival.

<p>Students are expected to wipe down keyboards and monitors with disinfectant wipes (provided) both before and after use.

<p>For further information about COVID-19-related policies, please refer to the Student Handbook.

<h4>FERPA Video Prohibition</h4>

Under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), your education records as a student are confidential and protected. Under most circumstances your records will not be released without your written and signed consent. Part of a student's protected and confidential education records include video and / or audio recordings of students within the classroom. As such, students are <b>strictly prohibited</b> from video or audio recording distance learning lectures off of any platform utilized by professors (Zoom, Webex, etc.). A prohibited recording includes, but is not limited to recordings using the platform, a cell phone, tablet, video camera, audio capture device, etc. Students may be subject to disciplinary action under the Student Code of Conduct if found to have made any video and/or audio recording distance learning lectures without proper consent.

<div id="R"><h2>R</h2></div>

<P>We will use R, a programming language for statistical computing, throughout the semester for in-class activities and homework assignments. I will cover the relevant features of R throughout the course.
	
<p>You should install R on your personal computer. You can install R by following the instructions <a href="https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/base/">for Windows here</a>, <a href="https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/macosx/">for macOS here</a>, or <a href="https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/linux/">for Linux here</a>. You will also want to install RStudio, and Integrated Development Environment for R, which you can find <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download">here</a>.

<p>We will use R as a scripting language and statistical calculator, and thus will not get into the nitty-gritty of programming in R. We will largely use functionality built into the <tt>mosaic</tt> library in R. You can find a comprehensive tutorial to using R and <tt>mosaic</tt> <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Horton+Pruim+Kaplan_MOSAIC-StudentGuide.pdf">here</a>.
