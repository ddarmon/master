<h1>MA 220-02, Probability and Statistics I</h1>

<h2>Spring 2019</h2>


<center>
Section 02: Monday and Wednesday, 11:40 AM &mdash; 1:00 PM, Howard Hall 307
</center>

<P>Here's the official description:
<blockquote>To provide an axiomatic, calculus-based approach to probability and introductory statistics. The course is built around the process of performing a statistical analysis; posing the question, collecting the data, describing the data, analyzing and modeling the data, and drawing inferences from the data regarding the original question. Specific topics covered include sampling, descriptive analysis of data, probability, random variables, discrete and continuous distributions, expectation, confidence intervals, one sample hypothesis testing, chi-square analyses, correlation and regression.</blockquote>

<P>This course covers the process of statistical analysis from beginning to end. That process, in broad strokes, is as follows: we pose a scientific question, determine what experiments or observations might provide data towards answering that question, develop approaches to collecting that data, summarize the resulting data, and derive inferences relevant to the original scientific question. In the process, we will learn about sampling, descriptive statistics, probability, probability models, inferential statistics, confidence intervals, hypothesis tests, and regression. A special emphasis will be given to common pitfalls in statistical analysis you are likely to see 'in the wild', including mis-interpretations / mis-understandings of statistical procedures, the conflation of association and causation, and the reproducibility crisis in psychology, medicine, and nutrition. 

<h4>Prerequisites</h4>

<h2>Course Mechanics</h2>

<h4>Office Hours</h4>

<p>I will have office hours at the following four times each week:

<center><table>
    <tr><td>Monday, &nbsp;&nbsp;10:00&mdash;11:00 AM</td> <td>Howard Hall 241</td></tr>
</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Tuesday, &nbsp;&nbsp;03:00&mdash;04:00 PM</td> <td>Howard Hall 241</td></tr>
</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Thursday, 10:00&mdash;11:00 AM</td> <td>Howard Hall 241</td></tr>
</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Thursday, 01:30&mdash;02:30 PM</td> <td>Howard Hall 241</td></tr>
</table></center>

<p>I have an open-door policy during those times: you can show up unannounced. If you cannot make the scheduled office hours, please e-mail me about making an appointment.

<p>If you are struggling with the homework, having difficulty with the quizzes, or just want to chat, please visit me during my office hours. I am here to help.

<h4>Grading Policy</h4> 

Your final grade will be determined by the following weighting scheme:

<dl>
	<dd> 45% for 2 in-class exams (22.5% each)
	<dd> 25% for a cumulative final exam
	<dd> 15% for homework problem sets
	<dd> &nbsp;&nbsp;5% for pre-class preparation
	<dd> &nbsp;&nbsp;5% for quizzes
	<dd> &nbsp;&nbsp;5%  for class participation
</dl>

I will use the standard 10-point breakdown to assign letter grades to numerical grades:
<ul>
	<li> \([90, 100] \to \text{A}\)
	<li> \([80, 90) \,\,\, \to \text{B}\)
	<li> \([70, 80) \,\,\, \to \text{C}\)
	<li> \([60, 70) \,\,\, \to \text{D}\)
	<li> \([0, 60) \,\,\,\,\,\, \to \text{F}\)
</ul>

<h4>Homework</h4>

Homework will be assigned at the end of every class meeting, and listed in the <a href="#schedule">Schedule</a> section of this page. Homework assignments are due at the beginning of the next class meeting.

<h4>Pre-class Preparation</h4>

<p>One of the most important skills needed to master mathematics is memory. To do mathematics, you need to make connections between concepts stored in your long-term memory, and before you can do that, you need to store those memories in the first place. One of the best methods for strengthening long-term memory is <strong>retrieval practice</strong> (think flash cards) combined with <strong>spaced repetition</strong> (think reviewing flash cards on an intelligent schedule). This is the exact opposite of how many students study, which typically takes the form of browsing notes (and thus skipping over retrieving the information from their own memories) immediately before the information is needed (i.e. 'cramming'). Unfortunately, this is one of the worst ways to commit information to long-term memory, despite the fact that cramming <em>feels</em> effective in the short-term. Retrieval practice with spaced repetition is more effective than the browse-and-cram approach, takes less time, and is more enjoyable!

<p>As part of pre-class preparation, you are required to regularly use Anki, and submit your Anki decks via eCampus. See <a href = "#anki">below</a> for details on Anki.

<p>See <a href = "MA-220-SP19/additional-syllabus-pages/preclass-prep-instructions.html">here</a> for the instructions on submitting your Anki decks via eCampus.

<h4>Quizzes</h4>

<p> There will be a 10-minute quiz at the beginning of every class. The quizzes will be cumulative, covering material from the first lecture through the most recent lecture. These quizzes are meant to be diagnostic: they direct you to gaps in your understanding of the material so that you can course correct before exams. As long as you are on time for a quiz and make a good-faith attempt to complete the quiz, you will receive full credit for that quiz.

<p> Up to 4 missed quizzes will be dropped. As such, there will be no make-up quizzes.

<h4>Class Participation</h4>

I expect you to be fully engaged during each class, to ask questions when confused, and to attempt to answer questions when called on. If I notice that the same students are always answering each question, I may begin randomly sampling from students. I will announce this before doing so. During class, attempting to answer a question is more important than getting the correct answer, and class participation will be assigned accordingly.

<h4>Attendance</h4>

Required. If you expect to miss 2-3 sessions of the course, you should take the course during another semester.

<h4>Examination Absences</h4>

If you miss an examination your grade will be zero for that exam.  If you know you will be absent for an exam you must let me know at least one week in advance to schedule a make-up exam.

<h4>Textbook</h4>

<P>The <strong>required</strong> textbook is:
<ul>
<li>Jay L. Devore and Kenneth N. Berk. <em>Modern mathematical statistics with applications</em>, 1st Edition (Cengage Learning, 2007). <a href = "http://mubookstore.monmouth.edu/TextBookDetail.aspx?BookPriceID=2292893&MBSNumber=747336&SecID=9614832&trm=SPRING%2019#.XBl34y2ZNhE">Link to University Store</a>
</ul>

<h4>Collaboration, Cheating, and Plagiarism</h4>

All submitted work should be your own. You are welcome and encouraged to consult with others while working on an assignment, including other students in the class and tutors in the <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/department-mathematics/math-learning-center/">Mathematics Learning Center</a>.  However, whenever you have had assistance with a problem, you must state so at the beginning of the problem solution.  Unless this mechanism is abused, there will be no reduction in credit for using and reporting such assistance.  This policy applies to both individual and group work. In group work, you only need to acknowledge help from outside the group. This policy does <b>not</b> apply to examinations.

<h4>Statement on Special Accommodations</h4>

Students with disabilities who need special accommodations for this class are encouraged to meet with me or the appropriate disability service provider on campus as soon as possible.  In order to receive accommodations, students must be registered with the appropriate disability service provider on campus as set forth in the student handbook and must follow the University procedure for self-disclosure, which is stated in the University <em>Guide to Services and Accommodations for Students with Disabilities</em>.  Students will not be afforded any special accommodations for academic work completed prior to the disclosure of the disability, nor will they be afforded any special accommodations prior to the completion of the documentation process with the appropriate disability office.

<div id="R"><h2>R</h2></div>

<P>We will use R, a programming language for statistical computing, throughout the semester for in-class activities and homework assignments. I will cover the relevant features of R throughout the course.

<p>R will be installed on all of the classroom computers. You should also install R on your personal computer, if you have one. You can install R by following the instructions <a href="https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/base/">for Windows here</a>, <a href="https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/macosx/">for macOS here</a>, or <a href="https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/linux/">for Linux here</a>. You will also want to install RStudio, and Integrated Development Environment for R, which you can find <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download">here</a>.

<p>We will use R as a scripting language and statistical calculator, and thus will not get into the nitty-gritty of programming in R. The <a href="https://www.cyclismo.org/tutorial/R/">R Tutorial by Kelly Black</a> is a good reference for the basics of using R. I will demonstrate R's functionality in class and handouts as we need it.

<div id="anki"><h2>Anki</h2></div>

<P> We will use <a href = "https://ankiweb.net/about">Anki</a> for spaced retrieval practice throughout the semester. Anki is open-source, free (as in both <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre"><em>gratis</em> and <em>libre</em></a>) software. You can download Anki to your personal computer from <a href = "https://apps.ankiweb.net/#download">this link</a>. If you have ever used flashcards, then Anki should be fairly intuitive. If you would like more details you can find Anki's User Manual <a href = "https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html">here</a>.

<P> <strong>Note:</strong> Anki has both desktop and mobile phone variants. Please use the desktop variant.
