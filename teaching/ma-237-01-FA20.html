<h1>MA 237-01, Programming and Technology in Mathematics</h1>

<h2>Fall 2020</h2>

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <div style="display: inline-block; text-align: left;">
        Tuesday, Thursday, 11:40 AM &ndash; 1:00 PM, Howard Hall 307</br>
        Friday, 11:40 AM &ndash; 1:00 PM, Remote via Zoom
    </div>
</div>

<P>This course provides an introduction to the use of technology as a mathematician. A major component of the course consists of building a solid foundation in the skills needed to apply mathematical concepts to programming and vice versa. In addition, the use of technology in written and oral communication and scholarly searches will be covered. Students will also gain an appreciation for the important ethical and social issues related to using technology. Mathematics and programming are inherently social, so students will also learn the customs and conventions of the tribe of mathematicians who use Python, LaTeX, and SageMath.

<h4>Prerequisites</h4>

<P>MA-120 and MA-126 both passed with a grade of C- or higher.

<h2>Course Mechanics</h2>

<h4>Office Hours</h4>

<p>I will have office hours at the following four times each week:

<center><table>
    <tr><td>Tuesday, &nbsp;&nbsp;01:30&mdash;02:30 PM</td> <td>Howard Hall 241</td></tr>
</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Thursday, 10:00&mdash;11:00 AM</td> <td>Howard Hall 241</td></tr>
</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Thursday, 01:30&mdash;02:30 PM</td> <td>Howard Hall 241</td></tr>
</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Friday, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;09:00&mdash;10:00 AM</td> <td>Howard Hall 241</td></tr>
</table></center>

<p>I will be available for office hours both in-person and on Zoom. For in-person office hours, please email me to make an appointment during one of the times above.

<p>If you are struggling with the homework, having difficulty with the quizzes or exams, or just want to chat, please visit me during my office hours. I am here to help.

<h4>Grading Policy</h4> 

Your final grade will be determined by the following weighting scheme:

<dl>
	<dd> 30% for homework problem sets
	<dd> 10% for labs
	<dd> 10% for quizzes
	<dd> 20% for exams (10% each)
	<dd> 20% for final project
	<dd> 5% for programming journal
	<dd> 5% for class participation
</dl>

I will use the standard 10-point breakdown to assign letter grades to numerical grades:
<ul>
	<li> \([90, 100] \to \text{A}\)
	<li> \([80, 90) \,\,\, \to \text{B}\)
	<li> \([70, 80) \,\,\, \to \text{C}\)
	<li> \([60, 70) \,\,\, \to \text{D}\)
	<li> \([0, 60) \,\,\,\,\,\, \to \text{F}\)
</ul>
with pluses and minuses assigned by dividing the intervals into thirds.

<h4>Homework</h4>

<p>Homework will be assigned regularly, announced in class, and listed in the <a href="#schedule">Schedule</a> section of this page.

<p>Each homework problem will be graded out of three points: one point for making an honest effort to complete the problem, one point for a technically-correct solution, and one point for clean, well-formatted, documented, and easily readable code.

<p>You will have the opportunity to revise your homework within a week after it is returned and resubmit the new solution to earn back partial credit.

<h4>Labs</h4>

<p>There will be (approximately) weekly labs. The labs will involve brief exercises related to the latest homework assignment. Attending labs is mandatory. If you miss a lab, your grade for that lab will be a 0.

<p><em>Pair programming:</em> Labs will be completed in groups using "pair programming," a software development technique where programmers alternate between two roles: a <em>driver</em> who writes the code and an <em>observer</em> who reviews each line of code for correctness and strategizes ways to improve the code moving forward. For each lab, you will randomly be assigned to a partner and the role of either driver or observer. Halfway through the lab, you will switch roles with your partner.
	
<h4>Quizzes</h4>

There will be a 20-minute quiz at the beginning of the first lecture after most lab sessions. Quizzes will be announced in advance. Each quiz will contain problems related to the material covered in the readings and during the lectures for a given unit of material. If you miss a quiz, your grade will be a zero for that quiz. Your lowest two quiz grades will be dropped.

<h4>Final Project</h4>

There will be a month-long final project at the end of the course. You will be assigned into small groups, or, if you prefer, may work alone. You will select a project topic from a list provided by me in the beginning of November. You will write code, document it, write a report, and prepare a presentation on your work to present during the final exam period for this class.

<h4>Programming Journal</h4>

<p>Learning to program, like learning any new skill, can be frustrating. The computer will always do what you tell it do, which is not always what you want it to do, and determining how to bridge that gap is simultaneously the challenge and the reward of programming. Over the course of the semester, you will keep a <em>programming journal</em>, a document where you record your thoughts about your journey into programming, the struggles you have faced, and the challenges you have overcome. You will also use the programming journal to document common errors that you run into and how to solve them.

<p>You should maintain your programming journal regularly, as you would a personal journal. Updates to your programming journal will be due on the first lecture following each lab.

<h4>Class Participation</h4>

You are expected to actively participate during each lecture. This includes responding to questions I pose to the class, as well as raising additional questions you may have as I present the material. I will regularly call on both volunteers and non-volunteers and you are expected to either attempt to answer the question or explain your current confusion.

<h4>Zoom</h4>

We will use Zoom for our remote meetings. During a remote meeting, try to make your surroundings conducive to learning: find a quiet place, close applications and windows on your computer unrelated to class, and clear your work area of other possible distractions. While you are not required to have your video on during the lecture, having it on is highly encouraged. You are expected to have the ability to talk during lecture. Under extenuating circumstances where you are unable to talk, you may interact with the class via the Chat feature in Zoom.

In the event that a quiz or test must be taken remotely, I will provide guidelines for how we will hold the quiz or test over Zoom. For these sessions, you <b>will</b> be expected to have your video on.

<h4>Attendance</h4>

Required. If you expect to miss 2-3 sessions of the course, you should take the course during another semester.

<h4>Examination Absences</h4>

If you miss an examination your grade will be zero for that exam. If you know you will be absent for an exam you must let me know at least one week in advance to schedule a make-up exam.

<h4>Textbook</h4>

<P>The <strong>required</strong> textbooks are:
<ul>
<li> Bruce E. Shapiro. <em>Scientific Computation: Python 3 Hacking for Math Junkies</em> (CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, 4th edition, 2018). <a href="http://calculuscastle.com/pythonbook.html">Digital Version</a>, <a href="http://mubookstore.monmouth.edu/SelectCourses.aspx?src=2&type=2&stoid=34&trm=FALL%2020&cid=115434">Campus Bookstore</a>
</ul>

<h4>Collaboration, Cheating, and Plagiarism</h4>

All submitted work should be your own. You are welcome and encouraged to use the Internet and consult with others while working on an assignment.  However, whenever you have had assistance with a problem, you must state so at the beginning of the problem solution.  Unless this mechanism is abused, there will be no reduction in credit for using and reporting such assistance. This policy applies to both individual and group work. In group work, you only need to acknowledge help from outside the group.

<h4>Statement on Special Accommodations</h4>

Students with disabilities who need special accommodations for this class are encouraged to meet with me or the appropriate disability service provider on campus as soon as possible.  In order to receive accommodations, students must be registered with the appropriate disability service provider on campus as set forth in the student handbook and must follow the University procedure for self-disclosure, which is stated in the University <em>Guide to Services and Accommodations for Students with Disabilities</em>.  Students will not be afforded any special accommodations for academic work completed prior to the disclosure of the disability, nor will they be afforded any special accommodations prior to the completion of the documentation process with the appropriate disability office.

<h4>School of Science Commitment to Equity and Inclusion</h4>

The School of Science does not discriminate based on race, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or religion. We strive to create a learning environment that allows everyone to succeed and grow. Towards that end, we are here to assist you in any way we can. Should you experience any difficulties or challenges due to discriminatory or harassing behaviors of any sort in your classes, please know that many people are available to help. You can contact your professor, your academic advisor, the department chair, or any of the Deans (Dean Bachrach, Associate Dean Duckett and Assistant Dean Tiedemann) by email or phone or to meet in person by appointment.  There are also resources available in the larger University community including the Office of Equity and Diversity and the Intercultural Center.

<h4>COVID-19 and In-person Meetings</h4>
 
<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is critically important that we care for ourselves and each other by taking strict measures to avoid spreading SARS-CoV-2. It is therefore a requirement that face masks are worn properly and appropriate physical distancing is maintained at all times during all classes. 

<p>When entering a room, please pick up disinfectant wipes and move as far into the classroom as possible in order to help maintain physical distances. Similarly, leave the room in an orderly fashion and dispose of the wipes on the way out.

<p>Students should wipe down their desktops upon arrival.

<p>Students are expected to wipe down keyboards and monitors with disinfectant wipes (provided) both before and after use.

<p>For further information about COVID-19-related policies, please refer to the Student Handbook.

<h4>FERPA Video Prohibition</h4>

Under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), your education records as a student are confidential and protected. Under most circumstances your records will not be released without your written and signed consent. Part of a student's protected and confidential education records include video and / or audio recordings of students within the classroom. As such, students are <b>strictly prohibited</b> from video or audio recording distance learning lectures off of any platform utilized by professors (Zoom, Webex, etc.). A prohibited recording includes, but is not limited to recordings using the platform, a cell phone, tablet, video camera, audio capture device, etc. Students may be subject to disciplinary action under the Student Code of Conduct if found to have made any video and/or audio recording distance learning lectures without proper consent.

<div id="Python"><h2>Python</h2></div>

<P>We will use Python regularly throughout the semester.

<p>You can access Python from any web accessible computer using <a href = "https://colab.research.google.com">Google Colab</a>. You will need a <a href="https://accounts.google.com/signup">Google account</a>. I will send out a link via email to a shared Google Drive folder for the course. Resources for homeworks, labs, etc., will be hosted on Google Drive for easy access.
	
<p>You should also install Python on your personal computer, if you have one. You can install the Anaconda distribution of Python from <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual">this link</a>. Be sure to install Python 3.8.
