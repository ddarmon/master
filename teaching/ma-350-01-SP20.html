<h1>MA 350-01, Computation and Statistics</h1>

<h2>Spring 2020</h2>

<center>
Monday and Thursday, 1:15 PM &mdash; 2:35 PM, Howard Hall 307
</center>

<P>The modern approach to statistics can broadly be broken into two distinct tasks: <em>algorithms</em> for computing statistical quantities (point estimates, confidence intervals, \(P\)-values, etc.) from data and <em>inferences</em> to be made from those quantities based on statistical models of how the data were generated. Until now in your statistical education, the focus has been on the <em>inferential</em> aspect of statistics. This class is a first course on the <em>algorithmic</em> side of statistics. You will learn the core concepts of programming &mdash; functions, objects, data structures, flow control, debugging, logical design, and abstraction &mdash; by writing code to implement statistical algorithms. You will also learn how to use stochastic simulation to evaluate a statistical algorithm in terms of its inferential properties. Programming and programming languages are inherently social, so you will also learn the customs and conventions of the tribe of programmers who use R as well as best-practices for organizing and commenting your code.

<h2>Course Mechanics</h2>

<h4>Office Hours</h4>

<p>I will have office hours at the following four times each week:

<center><table>
    <tr><td>Monday, &nbsp;&nbsp;10:00&mdash;11:00 AM</td> <td>Howard Hall 241</td></tr>
</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Tuesday, &nbsp;&nbsp;03:00&mdash;04:00 PM</td> <td>Howard Hall 241</td></tr>
</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Thursday, 10:00&mdash;11:00 AM</td> <td>Howard Hall 241</td></tr>
</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Thursday, 03:00&mdash;04:00 PM</td> <td>Howard Hall 241</td></tr>
</table></center>

<p>I have an open-door policy during those times: you can show up unannounced. If you cannot make the scheduled office hours, please e-mail me about making an appointment.

<p>If you are struggling with the homework, having difficulty with the quizzes, or just want to chat, please visit me during my office hours. I am here to help.

<h4>Grading Policy</h4> 

Your final grade will be determined by the following weighting scheme:

<dl>
	<dd> 30% for homework problem sets
	<dd> 10% for labs
	<dd> 30% for quizzes
	<dd> 20% for final project
	<dd> 10% for programming journal
</dl>

I will use the standard 10-point breakdown to assign letter grades to numerical grades:
<ul>
	<li> \([90, 100] \to \text{A}\)
	<li> \([80, 90) \,\,\, \to \text{B}\)
	<li> \([70, 80) \,\,\, \to \text{C}\)
	<li> \([60, 70) \,\,\, \to \text{D}\)
	<li> \([0, 60) \,\,\,\,\,\, \to \text{F}\)
</ul>
with pluses and minuses assigned by dividing the intervals into thirds.

<h4>Homework</h4>

<p>Homework will be assigned regularly, announced in class, and listed in the <a href="#schedule">Schedule</a> section of this page.

<p>Each homework problem will be graded out of three points: one point for making an honest effort to complete the problem, one point for a technically-correct solution, and one point for clean, well-formatted, documented, and easily readable code.

<p>You will have the opportunity to revise your homework within a week after it is returned and resubmit the new solution to earn back partial credit.

<h4>Labs</h4>

<p>There will be (approximately) weekly labs. The labs will involve brief exercises related to the latest homework assignment. Attending labs is mandatory. If you miss a lab, your grade for that lab will be a 0.

<p><em>Pair programming:</em> Labs will be completed in groups using "pair programming," a software development technique where programmers alternate between two roles: a <em>driver</em> who writes the code and an <em>observer</em> who reviews each line of code for correctness and strategizes ways to improve the code moving forward. For each lab, you will randomly be assigned to a partner and the role of either driver or observer. Halfway through the lab, you will switch roles with your partner.
	
<h4>Quizzes</h4>

There will be a 20-minute quiz at the beginning of each lab session. Each quiz will contain problems related to the material covered in the readings and during the lectures for a given unit of material. If you miss a quiz, your grade will be a zero for that quiz. Your lowest two quiz grades will be dropped.

<h4>Final Project</h4>

There will be a month-long final project at the end of the course. You will be assigned into small groups, or, if you prefer, may work alone. You will select a project topic from a list provided by me in the beginning of April. You will write code, document it, write a report, and prepare a presentation on your work to present during the final exam period for this class.

<h4>Programming Journal</h4>

<p>Learning to program, like learning any new skill, can be frustrating. The computer will always do what you tell it do, which is not always what you want it to do, and determining how to bridge that gap is simultaneously the challenge and the reward of programming. Over the course of the semester, you will keep a <em>programming journal</em>, a document where you record your thoughts about your journey into programming, the struggles you have faced, and the challenges you have overcome. You will also use the programming journal to document common errors that you run into and how to solve them.

<p>You should maintain your programming journal regularly, as you would a personal journal. Updates to your programming journal will be due on the first lecture following each lab.

<h4>Class Participation</h4>

I expect you to be fully engaged during each class, to ask questions when confused, and to attempt to answer questions when called on. During class, attempting to answer a question is more important than getting the correct answer.

<h4>Attendance</h4>

Required. If you expect to miss 2-3 sessions of the course, you should take the course during another semester.

<h4>Textbook</h4>

<P>The <strong>required</strong> textbooks are:
<ul>
<li>Norman Matloff. <em>The Art of R Programming: A Tour of Statistical Software Design</em> (No Starch Press, 2011).
<li>J.D. Long and Paul Teetor. <em>R Cookbook: Proven Recipes for Data Analysis, Statistics, and Graphics</em>, 2nd edition (O'Reilly Media, 2019).
</ul>

<h4>Collaboration, Cheating, and Plagiarism</h4>

All submitted work should be your own. You are welcome and encouraged to use the Internet and consult with others while working on an assignment.  However, whenever you have had assistance with a problem, you must state so at the beginning of the problem solution.  Unless this mechanism is abused, there will be no reduction in credit for using and reporting such assistance. This policy applies to both individual and group work. In group work, you only need to acknowledge help from outside the group.

<h4>Statement on Special Accommodations</h4>

Students with disabilities who need special accommodations for this class are encouraged to meet with me or the appropriate disability service provider on campus as soon as possible.  In order to receive accommodations, students must be registered with the appropriate disability service provider on campus as set forth in the student handbook and must follow the University procedure for self-disclosure, which is stated in the University <em>Guide to Services and Accommodations for Students with Disabilities</em>.  Students will not be afforded any special accommodations for academic work completed prior to the disclosure of the disability, nor will they be afforded any special accommodations prior to the completion of the documentation process with the appropriate disability office.

<div id="R"><h2>R</h2></div>

<P>We will use R regularly throughout the semester.

<p>You can access R from any web accessible computer using <a href = "https://rstudio.cloud">RStudio Cloud</a>. You will need to create an account on RStudio Cloud from their <a href = "https://login.rstudio.cloud/register">Registration page</a>. I will send out a link via email for you to join a Space on RStudio Cloud for this course. Resources for homeworks, labs, etc., will be hosted on RStudio Cloud for easy access.
	
<p>You should also install R on your personal computer, if you have one. You can install R by following the instructions <a href="https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/base/">for Windows here</a>, <a href="https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/macosx/">for macOS here</a>, or <a href="https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/linux/">for Linux here</a>. You will also want to install RStudio, and Integrated Development Environment for R, which you can find <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download">here</a>.
