Monday and Thursday, 1:15 PM &mdash; 2:35 PM, Howard Hall 307
</center>

<P>The modern approach to statistics can broadly be broken into two distinct tasks: <em>algorithms</em> for computing statistical quantities (point estimates, confidence intervals, \(P\)-values, etc.) from data and <em>inferences</em> to be made from those quantities based on statistical models of how the data were generated. Until now in your statistical education, the focus has been on the <em>inferential</em> aspect of statistics. This class is a first course on the <em>algorithmic</em> side of statistics. You will learn the core concepts of programming &mdash; functions, objects, data structures, flow control, debugging, logical design, and abstraction &mdash; by writing code to implement these statistical algorithms. You will also learn how to use stochastic simulation to evaluate a statistical algorithm in terms of its inferential properties. Programming and programming languages are inherently social, so you will also learn the customs and conventions of the tribe of programmers who use R as well as best-practices for organizing and commenting your code.

<h2>Course Mechanics</h2>

<h4>Office Hours</h4>

<p>I will have office hours at the following four times each week:

<center><table>
    <tr><td>Monday, &nbsp;&nbsp;10:00&mdash;11:00 AM</td> <td>Howard Hall 241</td></tr>
</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Tuesday, &nbsp;&nbsp;03:00&mdash;04:00 PM</td> <td>Howard Hall 241</td></tr>
</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Thursday, 10:00&mdash;11:00 AM</td> <td>Howard Hall 241</td></tr>
</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Thursday, 03:00&mdash;04:00 PM</td> <td>Howard Hall 241</td></tr>
</table></center>

<p>I have an open-door policy during those times: you can show up unannounced. If you cannot make the scheduled office hours, please e-mail me about making an appointment.

<p>If you are struggling with the homework, having difficulty with the quizzes, or just want to chat, please visit me during my office hours. I am here to help.

<h4>Grading Policy</h4> 

Your final grade will be determined by the following weighting scheme:

<dl>
	<dd> 20% for quizzes
	<dd> 20% for labs and homework problem sets
	<dd> 30% for final project
	<dd> 20% for comprehensive final exam
	<dd> 10% coding journal
</dl>

I will use the standard 10-point breakdown to assign letter grades to numerical grades:
<ul>
	<li> \([90, 100] \to \text{A}\)
	<li> \([80, 90) \,\,\, \to \text{B}\)
	<li> \([70, 80) \,\,\, \to \text{C}\)
	<li> \([60, 70) \,\,\, \to \text{D}\)
	<li> \([0, 60) \,\,\,\,\,\, \to \text{F}\)
</ul>
with pluses and minuses assigned by dividing the intervals into thirds.

<h4>Homework</h4>

Homework will be assigned regularly, and listed in the <a href="#schedule">Schedule</a> section of this page.

<h4>Labs</h4>

<p>There will be (approximately) weekly labs.

<h4>Class Participation</h4>

I expect you to be fully engaged during each class, to ask questions when confused, and to attempt to answer questions when called on. During class, attempting to answer a question is more important than getting the correct answer.

<h4>Attendance</h4>

Required. If you expect to miss 2-3 sessions of the course, you should take the course during another semester.

<h4>Examination Absences</h4>

If you miss an examination your grade will be zero for that exam.  If you know you will be absent for an exam you must let me know at least one week in advance to schedule a make-up exam.

<h4>Textbook</h4>

<P>The <strong>required</strong> textbook is:
<ul>
<li>Norman Matloff. <em>The Art of R Programming: A Tour of Statistical Software Design</em> (No Starch Press, 2011).
<li>J.D. Long and Paul Teetor. <em>R Cookbook: Proven Recipes for Data Analysis, Statistics, and Graphics</em>, 2nd edition (O'Reilly Media, 2019).
</ul>

<h4>Collaboration, Cheating, and Plagiarism</h4>

All submitted work should be your own. You are welcome and encouraged to consult with others while working on an assignment, including other students in the class and tutors in the <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/department-mathematics/math-learning-center/">Mathematics Learning Center</a>.  However, whenever you have had assistance with a problem, you must state so at the beginning of the problem solution.  Unless this mechanism is abused, there will be no reduction in credit for using and reporting such assistance.  This policy applies to both individual and group work. In group work, you only need to acknowledge help from outside the group. This policy does <b>not</b> apply to examinations.

<h4>Statement on Special Accommodations</h4>

Students with disabilities who need special accommodations for this class are encouraged to meet with me or the appropriate disability service provider on campus as soon as possible.  In order to receive accommodations, students must be registered with the appropriate disability service provider on campus as set forth in the student handbook and must follow the University procedure for self-disclosure, which is stated in the University <em>Guide to Services and Accommodations for Students with Disabilities</em>.  Students will not be afforded any special accommodations for academic work completed prior to the disclosure of the disability, nor will they be afforded any special accommodations prior to the completion of the documentation process with the appropriate disability office.

<div id="R"><h2>R</h2></div>

<P>We will use R regularly throughout the semester.

<p>You can access R from any web accessible computer using <a href = "https://rstudio.cloud">RStudio Cloud</a>. You will need to create an account on RStudio Cloud from their <a href = "https://login.rstudio.cloud/register">Registration page</a>. I will send out a link via email for you to join a Space on RStudio Cloud for this course. Resources for homeworks, labs, etc., will be hosted on RStudio Cloud for easy access.
	
<p>You should also install R on your personal computer, if you have one. You can install R by following the instructions <a href="https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/base/">for Windows here</a>, <a href="https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/macosx/">for macOS here</a>, or <a href="https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/linux/">for Linux here</a>. You will also want to install RStudio, and Integrated Development Environment for R, which you can find <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download">here</a>.
