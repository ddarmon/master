<h1>MA 380-01, Probability Methods for Actuarial Science</h1>

<h2>Spring 2019</h2>


<center>
Section 01: Tuesday, 1:15 PM &mdash; 2:35 PM; Thursday, 11:40 AM &mdash; 1:00 PM, Howard Hall 205
</center>

<P>This course will cover the probability theory necessary to solve problems on the Society of Actuaries' (SOA's) Exam P, the first exam in the credentialing process for both the SOA and the Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS). This exam covers material from a first course in calculus-based probability theory. A (non-exhaustive) list of those topics are given in the <a href = "#topics">Topics, Notes, Readings section</a> below. The course will alternate between lectures on topics and informal problem solving sessions. The problem solving sessions will be run by you, the students, with my assistance. A special emphasis will be given to solving questions in the cleverest way possible, since the 'right' or 'long' way may take too long given the structure of Exam P. In addition to covering the probability theory included on Exam P, we will learn about the career paths available to actuaries, and have guest speakers discuss their experiences as actuaries.

<P>This is currently a <em>tentative</em> listing of topics, in order.


<dl>
	<dt><em>Introduction:</em> What is an actuary? What is actuarial science? The credentialing process for becoming an actuary. Exam P. Tips and tricks for life-long learning.
    <dt><em>Combinatorial Probability:</em> Finding the probability of an outcome by counting. Combinatorics. Permutations, combinations, multisets, and all of the other ways to assign \(n\) items to \(k\) slots. How combinatorics relates to sampling.
    <dt><em>Probability:</em> Probability as a measure on a set. Set operations: union, intersection, difference, and so on. Venn diagrams for reasoning about probabilities. Sample spaces and events. Assigning probabilities to events, in all the ways.
    <dt><em>Discrete random variables:</em> How to talk about discrete random variables: probability mass functions, cumulative distribution functions, expectations, and moment generating functions. Discrete random vectors as multidimensional generalizations of discrete random variables.
    <dt><em>Some parametric discrete distributions:</em> Uniform. Bernoulli. Descendants of Bernoulli: binomial, negative binomial, geometric. Like binomial, but without replacement: hypergeometric. Poisson.
    <dt><em>Continuous random variables:</em> How to talk about continuous random variables: probability density functions, cumulative distribution functions, expectations, and moment generating functions. Mixed-type random variables.
    <dt><em>Some parametric continuous distributions:</em> Exponential. Normal. Gamma. Beta. Connections between families of random variables. The Russian inequalities. The law of large numbers. The central limit theorem.
    <dt><em>Random vectors and multivariate distributions:</em> How to talk about random vectors:  joint probability mass / density functions, joint cumulative distribution functions, and joint moment generating functions. Expectations of random vectors. Conditional random variables and conditional distributions.
    <dt><em>More techniques in probability theory:</em> Transformations of random variables. Order statistics. More on the moment generating function. More on variances and covariances via linear algebra. More on conditioning arguments.

<h2>Course Mechanics</h2>

<h4>Office Hours</h4>

<p>I will have office hours at the following four times each week:

<center><table>
    <tr><td>Monday, &nbsp;&nbsp;10:00&mdash;11:00 AM</td> <td>Howard Hall 241</td></tr>
</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Tuesday, &nbsp;&nbsp;03:00&mdash;04:00 PM</td> <td>Howard Hall 241</td></tr>
</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Thursday, 10:00&mdash;11:00 AM</td> <td>Howard Hall 241</td></tr>
</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Thursday, 01:30&mdash;02:30 PM</td> <td>Howard Hall 241</td></tr>
</table></center>

<p>I have an open-door policy during those times: you can show up unannounced. If you cannot make the scheduled office hours, please e-mail me about making an appointment.

<p>If you are struggling with the homework, having difficulty with the quizzes, or just want to chat, please visit me during my office hours. I am here to help.

<h4>Grading Policy</h4> 

Your final grade will be determined by:

<dl>
	<dd> 60% for 3 in-class exams (20% each)
	<dd> 25% for a cumulative final exam
	<dd> 12% for homework problem sets
	<dd> &nbsp;&nbsp;3%  for class participation
</dl>

<h4>Homework</h4>

Homework will be assigned at the end of every class meeting, and listed in the <a href="#schedule">Schedule</a> section of this page. Homework assignments are due at the beginning of the next class meeting.

<h4>Attendance</h4>

Required. If you expect to miss 2-3 sessions of the course, you should take the course during another semester.

<h4>Examination Absences</h4>

If you miss an examination your grade will be zero for that exam.  If you know you will be absent for an exam you must let me know at least one week in advance to schedule a make-up exam.

<h4>Textbook</h4>

<P>The <strong>required</strong> textbook is:
<ul>
<li> Leonard A. Asimow and Mark M. Maxwell, <em>Probability & Statistics with Applications: A Problem Solving Text</em>, 2nd Edition (ACTEX Academic Series, 2015, ISBN: 9781625424723). <a href = "http://mubookstore.monmouth.edu/TextBookDetail.aspx?BookPriceID=7939676&MBSNumber=1846066&SecID=9880720&trm=SPRING%2019#.XC5bVC2ZNhE">Link to University Store</a>
</ul>

<h4>Collaboration, Cheating, and Plagiarism</h4>

All submitted work should be your own. You are welcome and encouraged to consult with others while working on an assignment, including other students in the class and tutors in the <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/department-mathematics/math-learning-center/">Mathematics Learning Center</a>.  However, whenever you have had assistance with a problem, you must state so at the beginning of the problem solution.  Unless this mechanism is abused, there will be no reduction in credit for using and reporting such assistance.  This policy applies to both individual and group work. In group work, you only need to acknowledge help from outside the group. This policy does <b>not</b> apply to examinations.

<h4>Statement on Special Accommodations</h4>

Students with disabilities who need special accommodations for this class are encouraged to meet with me or the appropriate disability service provider on campus as soon as possible.  In order to receive accommodations, students must be registered with the appropriate disability service provider on campus as set forth in the student handbook and must follow the University procedure for self-disclosure, which is stated in the University <em>Guide to Services and Accommodations for Students with Disabilities</em>.  Students will not be afforded any special accommodations for academic work completed prior to the disclosure of the disability, nor will they be afforded any special accommodations prior to the completion of the documentation process with the appropriate disability office.
