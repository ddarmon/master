Section X: DAY and DAY, X:XX--X:XX, Classroom Location
</center>

<P>Here's the official description:
<blockquote>Lorem ipsum.</blockquote>

<P>Short-hand description of class.

<P>During the class, you will do data analyses with existing software, and
begin learning to write your own simple programs to implement and extend key
techniques.  You will also have to write reports about your analyses.

<h4>Prerequisites</h4>

<P>Lorem ipsum.

<h4>Professor</h4>

<table>
<tr><td>Dr. David Darmon</td> <td>ddarmon [at] monmouth.edu</td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td></td><td>Office address</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Topics, Notes, Readings</h2>

<P>This is currently a <em>tentative</em> listing of topics, in order.


<dl>
	<dt><em>Topic 1:</em> Keywords from Topic 1.
	<dt><em>Topic 2:</em> Keywords from Topic 2.
	</dl>

See the end for the current lecture schedule, subject to revision.  Lecture notes will be linked there, as available.


<h2>Course Mechanics</h2>

Exams will be 30% of your grade, data-analysis projects 45%, and homework
25%.

<h4>Theory Exams</h4>

<P>There will be two in-class mid-term exams, both focusing on
the theoretical portions of the course.  Both exams will be cumulative.  Each
exam will be 15% of your final grade.

<h4>Data Analysis Projects</h4>

<P>There will be three take-home projects where you will analyze real data
sets, and write up your findings in the form of a scientific report.  You will
be graded both on the technical correctness of your work and on your ability to
clearly communicate your findings; in particular, raw computer output or code
are not acceptable.  (Rubrics and example reports will be made available before
the first DAP is assigned.)

<P>The DAPs are exams; consequently, collaboration is <em>not</em> allowed.
Each DAP will count for 15% of your final grade.






<h4>Homework</h4>

<P>The homework will give you practice in using the techniques you are learning
to analyze data, and to interpret the analyses.  They will also include some
theory questions, requiring you to do calculations or prove results
mathematically.  There will be one homework assignment every week in which
there is not an exam.  Every assignment will count equally towards 25% of your
grade.  Your lowest two homework grades will be dropped;
consequently, <strong>no late homework will be accepted for any
reason</strong>.

<P>Communicating your results to others is as important as getting good results
in the first place.  A portion of the points available for every homework will
be set aside to reflect the clarity of your writing, figures, data
presentation, and other marks of communication.  (Rubrics will be provided for
each assignment.)  In addition, at least two homeworks will be practice DAPs,
where you will have to write reports in the same manner as the data analysis
projects.



<h4>Formats and Submission of Assignments</h4>

<P>Except as otherwise noted in the schedule, all assignments will be due at 3
pm on Thursdays (i.e., at the beginning of class), through Blackboard.  Late
assignments are not accepted for any reason.  Coming late to class because you
are uploading an assignment is unacceptable.

<P>You will submit a PDF or HTML file containing a readable version of all your
write-ups, mathematics, figures, tables, and <em>selected</em> portions of code
as relevant.  <strong>Word files will not be graded.</strong>  (You may
write in Word if you must, but you need to submit either PDF or HTML.)

<P>You are strongly encouraged to use <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com">R
Markdown</a> to integrate text, code, images and mathematics.  If you do, you
will submit both the "knitted" PDF or HTML file, and the source .Rmd file.  If
you choose not to use R Markdown, you will submit both a humanly-readable file,
as PDF or HTML, and a separate plain-text file containing all your R code,
clearly commented and formatted to indicate which code section goes with which
problem.

<P>If you do not use an equation editor, <a href="http://www.latex-project.org">LaTeX</a>, etc., you may include pictures
or scans of hand-written mathematics as needed.



<h4>Interviews</h4>

To help gauge how well the class is going, and how well the grading reflects
actual understanding, every week (after the first week of classes), six
students will be selected at random, and will meet with the professor for
10--15 minutes each, to explain their work and to answer questions about it.
You may be selected on multiple weeks, if that's how the random numbers come
up.  This is <em>not</em> a punishment, but a way for the professor to see
whether the problem sets are really measuring learning of the course material;
being selected will not hurt your grade in any way (and might even help).
Refusing to participate on a week you are selected will, however, automatically
drop your final grade by one letter.



<h4>Office Hours</h4>

<P>If you want help with computing, please bring your laptop.

    <tr><td>DOW, X--X pm</td> <td>Office Location</td></tr>
</td></tr>
    <tr><td>DOW, X--Xpm</td> <td>Office Location</td></tr>
</table></center>

<P>If you cannot make the scheduled office hours, please e-mail me about making an appointment.


<h4>Blackboard</h4>

Blackboard will be used for submitting assignments electronically, and as a
gradebook.  All properly enrolled students should have access to the Blackboard
site by the beginning of classes.

<h4>Textbook</h4>

<P>The primary textbook for the course will be Kutner, Nachtsheim and
Neter's <cite>Applied Linear Regression Models</cite>, 4th edition
(McGraw-Hill, 2004,
ISBN <a href="http://www.powells.com/partner/35751/biblio/0-07-238691-6">0-07-238691-6</a>).
This is <strong>required</strong>.  (The fifth edition is also acceptable,
though if you use it, when specific problems or readings are assigned from the
text, you are responsible for ensuring that they match up with what's
intended.)





<P>Four other books are <strong>recommended</strong>:
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://people.bath.ac.uk/jjf23/">Julian J. Faraway</a>, <cite>Linear Models with R</cite>, second edition (CRC Press, 2014,

<h2>Computational Work</h2>


<P><a href="http://r-project.org/">R</a> is a free, open-source software
package/programming language for statistical computing.  Many of you will have
some prior exposure to the language; for the rest, now is a great time to start
learning.  Almost every assignment will require you to use it.  No other form
of computational work will be accepted.  If you are <em>not</em> able to use R,
or do not have ready, reliable access to a computer on which you can do so, let
me know at once.

<P><a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com">R Markdown</a> is an extension to R
which lets you embed your code, and the calculations it produces, in ordinary
text, which can also be formatted, contain figures and equations, etc.  Using R
Markdown is <strong>strongly encouraged</strong>.  If you do, you need to
submit both your "knitted" file (HTML or PDF, not Word), and the original
.Rmd file.

<P>If you choose to not use R Markdown, for all computational assignments
you need to submit both a properly-formatted humanly-readable write-up,
in PDF, and a raw text file contain your R code, commented so that
it is clear which pieces of code go with which problem.  The write-up
may be a .txt file, PDF, or HTML; Word files will not be graded.



<h4>R Resources</h4>


<P>Here are some resources for learning R:


<ul>
	<li>The official intro, "An Introduction to R", available online in
<a href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.html">HTML</a>
and <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.pdf">PDF</a>
	<li> John Verzani, "simpleR",
in <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Verzani-SimpleR.pdf">PDF</a>
	<li> <a href="http://www.statmethods.net/">Quick-R</a>.  This is
primarily aimed at those who already know a commercial statistics package like
SAS, SPSS or Stata, but it's very clear and well-organized, and others may find
it useful as well.
	<li>Patrick
Burns, <a href="http://www.burns-stat.com/pages/Tutor/R_inferno.pdf">The R
Inferno</a>.  "If you are using R and you think you're in hell, this is a map
for you."
	<li> Thomas Lumley, "R Fundamentals and Programming Techniques"
(<a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/tlumley/Rcourse/R-fundamentals.pdf">large
PDF</a>)
	<li> Paul Teetor, <cite>The R Cookbook</cite>, explains how to use R to
do many, many common tasks.  (It's like the inverse to R's help: "What command
does X?", instead of "What does command Y do?").
	<li> The <a href="../../statcomp/">notes for 36-350, Introduction to
Statistical Computing</a>
	<li> There are now many books about R.  Some recommendable ones:
		<ul>
		<li>Joseph Adler <cite>R in a Nutshell</cite>
(<a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596801717">O'Reilly, 2009</a>;
ISBN <a href="http://www.powells.com/partner/27627/biblio/9780596801700">9780596801700</a>).  Probably most useful for those with previous experience programming in another language.
		<li><a href="http://www.stats.uwo.ca/faculty/braun/">W. John Braun</a> and
<a href="http://www.stats.uwo.ca/faculty/murdoch/">Duncan
J. Murdoch</a>, <cite>A
First Course in Statistical Programming with R</a></cite> (Cambridge University Press, 2008; ISBN <a href="http://www.powells.com/partner/27627/biblio/9780521694247">978-0-521-69424-7</a>)
		<li>John M. Chambers, <cite>Software for Data Analysis:
Programming with R</cite>
(<a href="http://springer.com/book/978-0-387-75935-7">Springer, 2008</a>,
ISBN <a href="http://www.powells.com/partner/27627/biblio/978-0-387-75935-7">978-0-387-75935-7</a>).
The best book on writing clean and reliable R programs; probably more advanced
than you will need.
		<li><a href="http://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/people/faculty/matloff.html">Norman
Matloff</a>, <Cite>The Art of R Programming</cite> (No Starch Press, 2011,
ISBN <a href="http://www.powells.com/partner/27627/biblio/9781593273842">978-1-59327-384-2</a>).
Good introduction to programming for complete novices using R.  Less statistics
than Braun and Murdoch, more programming skills.
		</ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf">The R Markdown Cheat Sheet</a>
	</ul>


Even if you know how to do some basic coding (or more), you
should read the page of <a href="http://bactra.org/weblog/593.html">Minimal
  Advice on Programming</a>.
